Cursor AI is a VS Code fork by Anysphere that adds native AI tab completion, inline editing, multi-file Composer 2.0, and autonomous Agent Mode directly into the editor. Install it in under five minutes, import your existing VS Code settings, pick a model, and you're writing AI-assisted code within the hour.

## What Is Cursor AI and Why Use It in 2026?

Cursor AI is an AI-native code editor built by Anysphere as a direct fork of VS Code, meaning it looks and feels like the editor you already know but replaces every edit surface with AI capabilities. As of 2026, Cursor has crossed 1 million users and 360,000 paying customers — including teams at over 50% of Fortune 500 companies — making it the fastest-adopted developer tool since GitHub Copilot. Version 3.0 shipped Background Agents, Cloud Agents for Business teams, and Composer 2.0, which can coordinate changes across dozens of files in a single guided session. The editor supports macOS 12+, Windows 10+, and Linux, and costs $0 on the free tier (2,000 AI completions/month) or $20/month for Pro with unlimited fast requests. The core value proposition: instead of switching between your editor and a chat window, every interaction — completion, refactoring, debugging, testing — happens inline without context-switching.

## System Requirements and Prerequisites

Before downloading, confirm your environment meets the minimum spec. Cursor v3.0 requires macOS 12 Monterey or later, Windows 10 (64-bit) or later, or a modern Linux distribution with a supported desktop environment. On RAM, 8 GB is the bare minimum but 16 GB is strongly recommended — Agent Mode and Background Agents spawn sub-processes that hold model context, which adds memory pressure. An SSD is de facto required; Cursor indexes your codebase on first open and reads from that index on every `@` mention in Chat. You do not need to install VS Code first — Cursor ships its own Electron runtime. You do need a Cursor account (free to create at cursor.com) to activate the free tier. Teams evaluating the Business tier ($40/user/month) should also check IT policy around privacy mode, which prevents code from being stored in Anysphere's infrastructure.

## Step 1: Download and Install Cursor

Cursor's installation follows the same pattern as any desktop app, and the full process takes under five minutes from download to first file open. Navigate to cursor.com, click Download, and the site auto-detects your OS and serves the right binary. The macOS installer is a standard `.dmg`; drag Cursor.app to Applications. On Windows, run the `.exe` installer with default options — Cursor adds itself to PATH automatically so you can launch it with `cursor .` from any terminal. On Linux, download the `.AppImage`, run `chmod +x cursor-*.AppImage`, and execute it directly; no root access or system-level install is needed, which makes it portable across machines. After first launch, Cursor prompts you to sign in or create a free account at cursor.com — the sign-up takes about 60 seconds. The free tier activates immediately with no credit card required: you get 2,000 fast AI completions and 50 slow requests per month, which is enough to evaluate all the core features. Once authenticated, you land in the welcome flow, which offers to import your VS Code settings and extensions. Accept this step — it's covered in detail in Step 2. You'll configure the AI model selection in Step 3.

## Step 2: Import VS Code Settings and Extensions

Cursor reads your VS Code configuration directly from disk, so the transition is near-instant. In the welcome modal, click "Import VS Code Settings." Cursor locates your VS Code `settings.json`, `keybindings.json`, and installed extensions and copies them into its own profile directory. Extensions that depend on the VS Code extension API work unchanged — language servers, linters, formatters, Git integrations, theme packs. Extensions that call VS Code-proprietary APIs (a small minority) may not load; Cursor logs these in the Output panel under "Extensions." After import, open any project you were working on in VS Code and the experience should be identical — same file tree, same color scheme, same shortcuts — plus the new AI sidebar on the left. If you don't have a VS Code installation to import from, skip this step; Cursor's defaults are sensible.

## Step 3: Configure AI Models for Different Tasks

Cursor routes requests to different models depending on the task type, and configuring this correctly is the single highest-leverage setup step. Open Settings (`Cmd/Ctrl + ,`) and navigate to **Cursor > Models**. For Tab Completion — low-latency predictions that fire on every keystroke — use a fast small model: Cursor's default `cursor-small` is purpose-built for sub-100ms latency. For Chat and Composer, where you're asking questions or orchestrating multi-file edits, route to a frontier model: Claude Sonnet 4.6 is the 2026 default for most teams because it balances reasoning quality with speed. For Agent Mode tasks that run autonomously over many steps, Claude Opus 4.7 or GPT-4o give better multi-step coherence. You can also connect your own API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google under **Cursor > AI Keys** — useful for Business teams that need per-org billing or want to use models not in Cursor's default list. Set a monthly spend cap under **Cursor > Billing** to avoid surprises.

| Use Case | Recommended Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Tab Completion | cursor-small | Sub-100ms latency, purpose-trained |
| Chat Q&A | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Fast reasoning, large context |
| Composer edits | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Multi-file coherence |
| Agent Mode | Claude Opus 4.7 | Long-horizon planning |
| Budget mode | GPT-4o mini | Cheap, adequate for simple tasks |

## Step 4: Master Tab Completion with Multi-Line Predictions

Cursor's Tab Completion is the feature most developers notice first — and it behaves differently from GitHub Copilot's single-line suggestions. Cursor predicts multi-line completions and adapts them to the exact cursor position, surrounding code, and recent edits within the file. The key interaction model: start typing, see the grey ghost text, press `Tab` to accept the full suggestion, or `Ctrl+Right` to accept one word at a time. Press `Esc` to dismiss. If the suggestion is wrong, just keep typing — Cursor re-predicts within ~200ms. Practical technique: write a comment explaining what you want (`// fetch user by email, return null if not found`), then press `Enter` and `Tab`. Cursor often generates the entire function body. For repetitive patterns — adding type annotations, writing test cases for a new function — let Tab Completion do the structural work while you focus on correctness. The free tier allows 2,000 completions/month; Pro gives unlimited fast completions.

## Step 5: Inline Editing with Cmd+K

Inline editing via `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) is Cursor's most surgical AI tool. Select any code, press the shortcut, and a small prompt bar appears inline — no chat panel, no context switch. Type your instruction ("make this async", "add error handling", "rename all params to camelCase", "convert to TypeScript") and press `Enter`. Cursor streams the edit directly into the selected region with a diff view — green for additions, red for deletions. Press `Tab` to accept or `Esc` to reject. For whole-file operations without a selection, press `Cmd+K` with nothing selected; Cursor operates on the visible viewport. Practical patterns: highlight a function and ask "add JSDoc with param types," select a SQL query and ask "rewrite as parameterized to prevent injection," or select a test file and ask "add edge cases for null and empty inputs." Cmd+K round-trips in ~2–5 seconds for most edits, making it faster than opening a separate chat for small transformations.

## Step 6: Chat with Codebase Context Using @Mentions

Cursor's Chat panel (`Cmd+L`) is a conversation interface with full codebase awareness via the `@` mention system. Unlike generic chatbots, Chat knows about your repo structure because Cursor indexes it locally on first open. Type `@` to see a menu of mentionable context types: `@Files` for specific files, `@Folders` for directories, `@Codebase` for a semantic search across the whole repo, `@Docs` for framework documentation, `@Web` for live web search, and `@Git` for recent diffs and commit history. Practical example: `@Codebase how does authentication middleware work in this project?` returns a grounded answer pointing to actual file paths, not generic advice. Use Chat for orientation questions ("what does this function call chain do?"), architecture decisions ("should I put this in a service or a hook?"), and code review ("@Files src/api/users.ts review this for security issues"). Chat messages persist in a session thread; start a new chat (`Cmd+Shift+L`) when switching topics to avoid polluting context.

## Step 7: Build Multi-File Features with Composer 2.0

Composer 2.0 (`Cmd+I`) is Cursor's answer to multi-file AI editing — it can open, read, modify, and create files across your entire project in a single guided session. Describe a feature at a high level ("add a password reset flow with email verification, a reset token model, and two new API routes") and Composer generates a plan, lists the files it will touch, and asks for confirmation before writing. You review each change as it streams in, can edit the prompt mid-session to redirect ("actually store the token in Redis, not the database"), and accept or reject per-file. Composer 2.0 improvements over v1: better plan coherence across more than 10 files, checkpoint saves so you can roll back to any step, and integration with Agent Mode for tasks that require running commands. Use Composer for new features, large refactors, and test generation across multiple files. Avoid it for tiny changes — Cmd+K is faster for single-function edits.

## Step 8: Set Up .cursorrules for Persistent Project Context

`.cursorrules` is a plain text file at your project root that Cursor injects into every AI request as system context. Think of it as a persistent prompt that keeps the AI aligned with your project conventions without you repeating them in every chat. Create the file at `<project-root>/.cursorrules` and write your rules in plain English. Effective rules are specific: instead of "write good code," write "use TypeScript strict mode, never use `any`, prefer `Result<T, E>` types over throwing exceptions, and follow the repository pattern for all database access." Include stack-specific rules: "this project uses Prisma for ORM, not raw SQL," "always use React Query for server state, never useEffect for fetching," "tests use Vitest and Testing Library, not Jest." Teams should version-control `.cursorrules` and treat it like a `CONTRIBUTING.md` that the AI also reads. After saving the file, restart Chat or Composer to pick up the new rules — they don't hot-reload mid-session in v3.0.

## Step 9: Use Agent Mode for Autonomous Task Execution

Agent Mode is Cursor's highest-autonomy feature — it gives the AI control of the terminal, file system, and editor to complete tasks end-to-end without step-by-step confirmation. Enable it in Composer by toggling "Agent" in the dropdown, or open the dedicated Agent panel. In Agent Mode, Cursor can run shell commands (`npm install`, `git commit`, `python script.py`), read command output, react to errors by editing code and retrying, and loop until the task succeeds or hits a limit. A practical workflow: "set up a new Express API project with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and a health-check endpoint, then run the tests to verify." Agent Mode handles everything — scaffolding, dependency install, config files, test execution. Guardrails: Agent Mode asks for permission before destructive operations (deleting files, force-pushing) by default. For production work, keep terminal sandboxing on and review the command log after each session. Background Agents (Business tier) run the same way but in Anysphere's cloud infrastructure, freeing your local machine.

## Step 10: Debug and Test with AI Assistance

Cursor integrates AI into the debugging loop in two useful ways. First, when your terminal shows an error, paste it into Chat with `@` pointing to the relevant file: `@Files src/server.ts TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id') — what's wrong?` Cursor analyzes the stack trace, locates the code path, and proposes a fix you can apply with one click. Second, use Composer to generate test suites: select a module and ask "write unit tests covering the happy path, null inputs, and network error cases." Composer generates the test file, runs it with your test runner if Agent Mode is on, and fixes failures automatically. For integration tests that require a database, tell Composer explicitly: "use a test database connection from the `TEST_DATABASE_URL` env var." Test generation quality is highest when `.cursorrules` specifies your test framework (Vitest, Jest, Pytest, etc.) so Cursor uses the right APIs from the start.

## Step 11: Integrate with Git and Terminal

Cursor's terminal is the standard VS Code integrated terminal — `Cmd+\`` opens it — with one addition: the AI terminal command feature. Press `Cmd+K` inside the terminal to describe what you want to do ("list all branches merged in the last 7 days and delete the ones not on main") and Cursor translates it to a shell command for review before execution. You can reject, edit, or run the command. For Git workflows, Cursor's Source Control panel (the branch icon in the left sidebar) adds AI-generated commit messages: stage your changes, click the sparkle icon in the commit message box, and Cursor summarizes the diff into a conventional commit message. For PR descriptions, use Chat with `@Git diff main` to get a summary of all changes since your branch diverged. If your team uses GitHub Actions or GitLab CI, store pipeline configs in the repo and reference them in `.cursorrules` so Cursor understands your CI constraints when generating code.

## Step 12: Optimize Performance and Keyboard Shortcuts

Performance tuning and shortcut fluency separate power users from beginners. For indexing performance: open Settings > Cursor > Indexing and add `node_modules`, `dist`, `.next`, and any large generated directories to the ignore list. Large ignored directories speed up both indexing and `@Codebase` search significantly. For model routing: if you notice Chat responses are slow, switch the Chat model from Opus to Sonnet for a 3–4x speed improvement on most queries. For keyboard shortcuts, the five highest-ROI bindings to memorize are: `Cmd+K` (inline edit), `Cmd+L` (open Chat), `Cmd+I` (open Composer), `Cmd+Shift+L` (new Chat thread), and `Tab` (accept completion). You can customize all of these in `Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts`. For teams, share a `keybindings.json` in the repo alongside `.cursorrules` so everyone uses consistent bindings.

## Pricing Breakdown: Free vs Pro vs Business (2026)

Cursor's pricing in 2026 reflects its position as a productivity tool rather than a toy. The free tier is genuinely useful — 2,000 fast AI completions/month and 50 slow requests covers light personal projects. Pro at $20/month removes most limits: unlimited fast completions, 500 fast Composer requests, and access to all frontier models. Business at $40/user/month adds privacy mode (code never leaves your org), SSO/SAML, centralized billing, audit logs, and Cloud Agents. Most individual developers land on Pro. Teams that process proprietary code or work in regulated industries (finance, healthcare, defense) need Business for the privacy guarantees.

| Tier | Price | Fast Completions | Composer | Privacy Mode |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Free | $0 | 2,000/month | 10 sessions | No |
| Pro | $20/month | Unlimited | 500 fast/month | No |
| Business | $40/user/month | Unlimited | Unlimited | Yes |

## 5 Common Cursor Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

**1. Accepting completions without reading them.** Tab Completion is fast but not infallible. Pause for one second before accepting multi-line suggestions, especially in security-critical code (auth, input validation, SQL). Use `Ctrl+Right` to accept word-by-word when unsure.

**2. Not setting `.cursorrules`.** Without project context, Cursor defaults to generic patterns that may conflict with your stack. The first 30 minutes you invest in a good `.cursorrules` file returns hours of avoided corrections.

**3. Using Composer for tiny edits.** Composer's strength is multi-file coordination. For single-function changes, Cmd+K is 5x faster. Match the tool to the scope.

**4. Running Agent Mode without reviewing the command log.** Agent Mode is powerful but can install unexpected packages or modify config files. Review the terminal log after every agent session before committing.

**5. Ignoring the `@Codebase` context type.** Most beginners chat without `@` mentions and get generic answers. Adding `@Codebase` or `@Files` turns generic advice into project-specific guidance grounded in your actual code.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Cursor won't index my codebase.** Check Settings > Cursor > Indexing > Ignored Paths. If `node_modules` or a large generated directory is being indexed, the indexer stalls. Add the directory to the ignore list and trigger a manual reindex via Command Palette > "Cursor: Reindex Codebase."

**Tab Completion stopped working.** First check your free tier usage — 2,000 completions/month resets on the billing date, not the calendar month. Open Cursor's account dashboard to verify. If usage is fine, toggle the completion model in Settings and back again to reset the connection.

**Composer applies changes to the wrong files.** This usually means Cursor's `@Codebase` index is stale. Reindex (Command Palette > "Cursor: Reindex Codebase") and retry. Also verify `.cursorrules` doesn't have contradictory file path instructions.

**Agent Mode terminal commands fail silently.** Check that your shell profile (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`) is sourced in non-interactive shells. Some tools (nvm, pyenv, rbenv) only activate in interactive shells. Add explicit `source ~/.zshrc` at the top of Agent Mode sessions or configure Cursor to use your full shell path.

## Advanced Tips for Power Users

**Multi-root workspaces:** Open multiple related repos in one Cursor window via File > Add Folder to Workspace. `@Codebase` searches across all roots, and Composer can edit files in any root. Useful for monorepo setups where the API and frontend are separate repos.

**Model routing by file type:** In Settings > Cursor > Models, you can assign different models per language. Use a smaller, faster model for plain-text files (markdown, JSON config) and reserve frontier models for TypeScript/Python where reasoning quality matters.

**MCP integrations:** Cursor v3.0 supports Model Context Protocol servers — plugins that extend Chat and Agent Mode with external tool access (GitHub PRs, Linear tickets, Notion docs, database queries). Install community MCP servers from the Cursor marketplace or write your own using the MCP SDK.

**Shared team `.cursorrules`:** For larger teams, store project-specific rules in `.cursorrules` at the repo root and personal preferences in `~/.cursor/rules/global.md`. Both are merged at request time — project rules take precedence on conflicts.

## FAQ

**Is Cursor AI free to use?**
Yes. The free tier gives 2,000 fast AI completions and 50 slow requests per month, which covers light personal use. Pro ($20/month) removes most limits and is what most active developers use.

**Does Cursor replace VS Code completely?**
Cursor is a fork of VS Code, so it retains all VS Code functionality — extensions, keybindings, themes, language servers. You can import your VS Code settings with one click. Most developers use Cursor as a drop-in replacement and don't keep VS Code installed.

**Is my code sent to Anysphere's servers?**
On the free and Pro tiers, code snippets and context are sent to AI model providers (Anthropic, OpenAI) to generate responses. Anysphere states it does not train on user code. The Business tier adds Privacy Mode, which routes requests through an isolated pipeline with contractual guarantees that code is not retained.

**Can I use my own OpenAI or Anthropic API key?**
Yes. Under Settings > Cursor > AI Keys, you can add your own API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google. This lets you use models not in Cursor's default list and bills usage directly to your API account rather than your Cursor subscription.

**How is Cursor different from GitHub Copilot?**
Copilot is a VS Code extension that adds single-line completions and a chat sidebar. Cursor is a full editor fork with multi-line Tab Completion, Cmd+K inline editing, Composer 2.0 for multi-file features, and Agent Mode for autonomous task execution. Cursor's context system (`@Codebase`, `@Git`, `@Docs`) is also significantly more powerful than Copilot's workspace context.
