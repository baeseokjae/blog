AnythingLLM is an open-source, self-hosted AI platform that bundles RAG document chat, multi-agent task automation, and multi-user workspace management into a single deployable package — with zero data leaving your infrastructure. As of early 2026, it has accumulated over 57,000 GitHub stars and remains MIT licensed.

## What Is AnythingLLM? Core Architecture and 2026 Positioning

AnythingLLM is a full-stack AI application layer, not an inference engine. It sits between your documents and your LLM provider, handling embedding, vector storage, retrieval, and conversation context so you don't have to wire these together yourself. The project is maintained by Mintplex Labs and has crossed 57,000 GitHub stars as of early 2026 — making it one of the most-starred self-hosted RAG projects in existence. The architecture is built around the concept of **workspaces**: isolated knowledge bases, each with its own document pool, embedding index, and conversation history. One workspace handles your engineering runbooks; another handles customer contracts; a third handles sales collateral — none of them bleed into each other. Under the hood, AnythingLLM delegates model inference entirely to external providers. It ships with LanceDB as its default on-instance vector store, which means embeddings persist locally without requiring a separate Postgres or Pinecone subscription. This design decision — orchestration without inference — is the reason AnythingLLM can support 30+ LLM backends without rewriting its core logic: Ollama, LM Studio, OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, AWS Bedrock, Groq, Together, Mistral, and DeepSeek all plug in via a provider abstraction layer.

The 2026 positioning is clear: AnythingLLM targets teams that need enterprise-grade RAG capabilities but cannot send documents to OpenAI or any third-party cloud. Healthcare companies with HIPAA compliance requirements, law firms protecting privileged communications, and financial institutions under SOC 2 scrutiny are the primary enterprise buyers. For individual developers, it is the fastest path from "pile of PDFs" to "functional document Q&A" without assembling a LangChain stack from scratch.

## Key Features: RAG, Agent Runtime, and MCP Integration

AnythingLLM's feature set spans three distinct capability layers — RAG document retrieval, AI agent task execution, and MCP-based external tool integration — making it one of the most complete open-source alternatives to enterprise knowledge management tools like Glean or Guru. As of Desktop v1.8.0, MCP (Model Context Protocol) support was added, which transforms AnythingLLM from a standalone RAG tool into a live knowledge backend that Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-aware clients can query in real time. This is the single most important new capability in 2026: your AnythingLLM workspaces become MCP resources, and any MCP client can call them without the user switching applications. For teams already using Claude Desktop for coding and writing, the integration means the same private knowledge base powers both the chat interface and the ambient AI assistant — without maintaining two separate document pipelines.

**RAG Pipeline.** Document ingestion supports PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, Markdown, audio transcription, and web scraping. The retrieval layer offers two modes: Fast Similarity (pure vector search) and Accuracy Optimized (reranking via a secondary model pass). Accuracy Optimized adds 100–500ms to response latency but produces measurably better results on long documents with overlapping topics. Embedding models are set system-wide — you cannot change the embedding model per workspace without re-embedding the entire corpus, which is a genuine operational constraint for multi-tenant deployments.

**Agent Runtime.** Agent mode enables tool use: web search via SearXNG or Brave, file operations (read/write on the host filesystem), Python/Node code execution in a sandboxed runner, and HTTP API calls to arbitrary endpoints. The newer **Agent Flows** feature provides a visual canvas for chaining these capabilities — LLM instructions, API calls, file operations — without writing code. Think of it as n8n but scoped to LLM workflows. For technical teams the ceiling is real: complex conditional branching or stateful multi-step processes still require dropping into code. But for the 80% of automation use cases that are linear — ingest → process → output — Agent Flows is genuinely useful without a developer writing the wiring.

**Multi-User and Security.** Docker deployment supports Admin, Manager, and Default roles. API-provisioned users, Simple SSO Passthrough, and white-labeling are available for enterprise deployments. An embeddable chat widget lets you surface a workspace as a support bot on documentation sites or internal portals with three lines of JavaScript.

## Desktop App vs. Docker: Which Deployment Is Right for You?

AnythingLLM ships in three deployment modes — a standalone Desktop app for individual users, a Docker container for self-hosted team deployments, and a managed cloud option — and the right choice depends primarily on whether you need multi-user access and how much operational overhead you're willing to absorb. The Desktop app is a single binary with an embedded server; it requires a minimum of 2GB RAM and runs everything in-process with no Docker dependency. Setup is under five minutes: download, install, configure an LLM provider, and start chatting with documents. The trade-off is that the Desktop app is single-user only — workspaces are not shareable, and there is no role-based access control.

| Deployment | Users | Min RAM | Setup Time | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Desktop App | 1 | 2GB | 5 min | Solo developers, evaluation |
| Docker Self-Hosted | Multi | 4GB | 30–60 min | Teams, enterprise, CI/CD |
| Managed Cloud | Multi | N/A (managed) | Minutes | Non-technical teams |

Docker deployment unlocks multi-user mode, API access, SSO integration, and the full admin panel. The recommended configuration is 4GB RAM minimum, though in practice a production deployment serving a 10-person team with a 7B model running locally via Ollama will want 16GB RAM and a GPU with 8GB+ VRAM to stay responsive. The Docker setup involves `docker pull mintplexlabs/anythingllm` and mounting a volume for persistent storage — standard stuff if you've deployed any containerized app before, but genuinely opaque if you haven't. The Mintplex Labs documentation covers the `docker-compose.yml` configuration in detail, including environment variables for LLM provider keys and the `STORAGE_DIR` mount.

The managed cloud option is the path of least resistance for non-technical teams. You get all multi-user features without maintaining infrastructure, at the cost of documents leaving your control — which defeats the primary privacy use case for most AnythingLLM adopters.

## Setting Up Your First Knowledge Base (Workspace Walkthrough)

Creating a functional RAG workspace in AnythingLLM takes under 15 minutes if you already have an LLM provider configured, and the workspace concept is the most important mental model to internalize before you start. A workspace is AnythingLLM's unit of isolation: each workspace has its own document pool, vector index, embedding configuration, chat history, and agent settings. Documents added to Workspace A are invisible to Workspace B. This is not a soft filter — the vector queries are scoped to the workspace's embeddings, so there is no cross-workspace retrieval leak even if you're running a single LanceDB instance under the hood.

**Step 1: Configure an LLM Provider.** In Settings → LLM Provider, select your backend. For fully local operation, choose Ollama and point it at your Ollama server URL (default: `http://localhost:11434`). For cloud providers, paste your API key. The embedding model is configured separately in Settings → Embedding Model — this is a system-wide setting that applies to all workspaces.

**Step 2: Create a Workspace.** Click "New Workspace" from the sidebar, give it a descriptive name, and optionally set a custom system prompt that scopes the assistant's behavior (e.g., "You are a legal document analyst. Only answer questions based on the uploaded contracts.").

**Step 3: Upload Documents.** Drag PDFs, Word documents, text files, or CSVs into the document panel. AnythingLLM chunks the documents, runs them through the embedding model, and stores the vectors in LanceDB. For large corpora (100+ documents), the initial embedding can take several minutes on CPU — plan accordingly.

**Step 4: Tune Retrieval Settings.** In workspace settings, switch from Fast Similarity to Accuracy Optimized if document quality matters more than response speed. Adjust the context window size to control how many retrieved chunks feed into the LLM prompt.

**Step 5: Test with Real Queries.** Open the chat interface and ask specific questions that require retrieval — not just "summarize this document" but "what are the termination clauses in the Q3 contract?" This will surface any chunking or retrieval failures before you share the workspace with colleagues.

## AnythingLLM vs. Open WebUI vs. PrivateGPT: Full 2026 Comparison

AnythingLLM, Open WebUI, and PrivateGPT represent three distinct design philosophies in the self-hosted AI space — and understanding the difference prevents a painful mid-project migration when you discover the tool you chose doesn't fit your actual workflow. The clearest way to frame the comparison: Open WebUI is chat-first with RAG bolted on; AnythingLLM is RAG-first with chat on top; PrivateGPT is privacy-first with a narrow feature scope. Each wins in a specific scenario.

| Feature | AnythingLLM | Open WebUI | PrivateGPT |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary design | RAG + Agents | Chat interface | Private doc Q&A |
| Multi-user support | Yes (Docker) | Yes | Limited |
| Agent/tool use | Yes (Agent Flows) | Limited | No |
| MCP support | Yes (v1.8.0+) | No | No |
| Vector DB | LanceDB (default) + 8 more | Chroma | Qdrant |
| Setup complexity | Medium | Low | Medium |
| LLM backends | 30+ | 10+ | Ollama-focused |
| White-labeling | Yes | No | No |
| MIT licensed | Yes | Yes | Apache 2.0 |

**Open WebUI** is the right choice when your primary need is a polished ChatGPT-like interface for a team using Ollama models — its model switching, conversation history, and UI polish are stronger than AnythingLLM's. But if document retrieval quality and multi-workspace isolation matter, Open WebUI's RAG implementation is shallow by comparison. Pinned documents and basic similarity search cover simple use cases; they don't scale to a 10,000-document enterprise corpus.

**PrivateGPT** is purpose-built for private document chat with minimal configuration. Its scope is intentionally narrow — it does not try to be a multi-agent runtime or an enterprise platform. For a solo developer who needs "ask questions about these PDFs, fully offline, no setup drama," PrivateGPT is faster to get running. But it lacks agent mode, multi-user access, and the extensibility of AnythingLLM's workspace system.

**AnythingLLM** wins when you need all three: serious RAG with tunable retrieval, multi-user access with role separation, and agent-based automation that goes beyond document Q&A. The trade-off is setup and operational complexity — Docker deployment, embedding model selection, and retrieval tuning all require technical familiarity that Open WebUI does not demand.

## Performance, Hardware Requirements, and Real Limitations

AnythingLLM's performance is almost entirely a function of your inference backend, not the AnythingLLM application layer itself — the app adds minimal overhead, but the LLM inference dominates latency, and the gap between CPU and GPU performance is severe enough to determine whether the tool is practically usable. A 7B parameter model (Llama 3, Mistral 7B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill) generates responses in 30–60 seconds on CPU versus 2–3 seconds on a GPU — a 15–20x difference. At 30 seconds per response, agent workflows that chain 3–5 LLM calls become 90–150 second operations. That is the practical ceiling for CPU-only deployments.

**Hardware Reality Check:**

| Use Case | Min RAM | Recommended RAM | GPU VRAM |
|---|---|---|---|
| Desktop (cloud LLM) | 2GB | 4GB | None needed |
| Docker + cloud LLM | 4GB | 8GB | None needed |
| Docker + 7B local model | 16GB | 32GB | 8GB+ |
| Docker + 13B local model | 32GB | 64GB | 16GB+ |

If you're running local inference through Ollama or LM Studio, the bottleneck is almost always the GPU. An NVIDIA RTX 3080 (10GB VRAM) handles 7B models smoothly; 13B models require offloading layers to RAM and will be noticeably slower. An RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM) runs 13B models fully in-VRAM and handles 34B models with partial offloading.

**Known Limitations:**

- **Embedding model is system-wide.** Changing the embedding model requires re-embedding all workspaces — a multi-hour operation on large corpora. Plan your embedding model choice before ingesting production documents.
- **Chunking is not configurable per-document.** Fixed chunking strategies work well for uniform documents (legal contracts, technical manuals) but poorly for mixed-format corpora (meeting transcripts, code repositories, slide decks).
- **Agent Flows has a ceiling.** Complex conditional logic, stateful loops, and error handling require custom code. Agent Flows is a visual tool for linear pipelines, not a replacement for a full workflow engine.
- **MCP support is Desktop-only.** As of v1.8.0, MCP integration works only in the Desktop app — Docker deployments don't expose an MCP server. Teams relying on Docker for multi-user access cannot yet use AnythingLLM as an MCP backend for Claude Desktop.
- **UX is functional but not polished.** The interface gets the job done but lacks the UI refinement of Open WebUI or commercial tools. Power users adapt quickly; non-technical end users may struggle.

## Real-World Use Cases: Solo Developers to Enterprise Teams

AnythingLLM earns its place differently depending on team size and technical context, and the clearest way to evaluate it is through concrete deployment patterns rather than feature checklists. Across the spectrum from solo developer to regulated enterprise, four use cases consistently justify the setup overhead and produce measurable productivity gains.

**Solo Developer: Personal Knowledge Base.** A developer with 500+ saved articles, technical documentation PDFs, and Notion exports installs the Desktop app, points it at Ollama running Llama 3 8B, and creates a single workspace called "Research." Documents get embedded once; queries return relevant excerpts in under 5 seconds on a GPU laptop. The entire setup is air-gapped — no API keys, no subscription, no documents leaving the machine. For developers who have been meaning to "organize their notes" for years, AnythingLLM actually ships a working system rather than another organizational framework.

**Small Team: Shared Internal Knowledge Base.** A 5-person startup deploys AnythingLLM via Docker on a shared server with Ollama running in a companion container. The team creates workspaces for Engineering (runbooks, architecture docs), Sales (product briefs, competitive analysis), and Customer Success (FAQ documents, escalation playbooks). Each team member logs in with their role, and workspace access is scoped accordingly. Questions like "what's our SLA for P1 incidents?" or "what's the difference between our Starter and Pro tiers?" get answered from documents rather than interrupting colleagues.

**Content and Research Teams: Competitive Intelligence.** A marketing team ingests competitor blog posts, product documentation, pricing pages, and analyst reports into a single workspace. Agent mode with web scraping enabled keeps the corpus fresh — a scheduled agent crawls specified URLs weekly and updates embeddings automatically. Researchers can ask "how does Competitor X position their enterprise tier?" and get an answer synthesized from six different documents, cited with sources.

**Regulated Enterprise: Compliance-Constrained AI.** A healthcare provider deploys AnythingLLM on-premise with local Ollama inference — no data touches external APIs. Clinical protocols, drug interaction databases, and procedure documentation are embedded and queried by clinical staff. The audit trail (conversation logs stored locally), role-based access control, and zero external data transmission make the deployment defensible to compliance teams.

## Verdict: Who Should Use AnythingLLM in 2026?

AnythingLLM is the strongest open-source option in 2026 for teams that need serious RAG capabilities, multi-user access, and agent automation under one roof — particularly when data residency or compliance requirements rule out managed SaaS. The MIT license and zero per-seat cost make it economically compelling at any team size. MCP integration in v1.8.0 is a genuine capability unlock: teams already using Claude Desktop or other MCP-aware tools can now pipe private knowledge into their AI assistant without a separate document pipeline. For organizations already investing in Claude as their AI layer, AnythingLLM as an MCP knowledge backend is one of the highest-leverage self-hosted integrations available in 2026.

**Use AnythingLLM if:**
- You have compliance requirements that prevent sending documents to OpenAI, Anthropic, or any cloud API
- You need workspace isolation across multiple teams, projects, or clients
- You want to run local inference (Ollama/LM Studio) without building your own orchestration layer
- Your team needs agent-based automation that goes beyond document Q&A
- You want MCP integration with Claude Desktop or other MCP-aware clients

**Consider alternatives if:**
- You primarily need a polished chat interface and basic model switching → **Open WebUI**
- You need simple private document Q&A with minimal setup → **PrivateGPT**
- You need managed infrastructure without ops overhead → **Notion AI, Guru, or Glean**
- Your team is non-technical and needs plug-and-play → **managed cloud tools**

The honest caveat: AnythingLLM is not plug-and-play. It requires Docker familiarity for team deployments, technical judgment on embedding model selection, and patience during the retrieval tuning phase. The reward for that investment is a fully private, fully capable AI knowledge layer that you own and operate — and that is exactly what the 57,000+ developers who starred the repository are paying for.

## FAQ

AnythingLLM is an MIT-licensed, self-hosted AI platform that combines RAG document retrieval, multi-agent task automation, and multi-user workspace management in a single deployable package — with all data remaining on your infrastructure. As of early 2026, the project has surpassed 57,000 GitHub stars and supports 30+ LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, LM Studio, Azure, AWS Bedrock, Groq, and DeepSeek. The platform is maintained by Mintplex Labs and ships with LanceDB as its default on-instance vector store, meaning vector embeddings persist locally without a separate database subscription. Three deployment modes are available: a lightweight Desktop app (2GB RAM minimum) for solo users, a Docker container for multi-user team deployments, and a managed cloud option. Key questions developers ask before adopting AnythingLLM involve licensing costs, offline operation capability, hardware requirements for local inference, comparison with Open WebUI and PrivateGPT, and MCP protocol support — the five questions below address each directly with practical specifics drawn from real deployments across solo developers and enterprise teams.

### Is AnythingLLM completely free?

Yes. AnythingLLM is MIT licensed and completely free for self-hosting with no per-seat cost. The managed cloud option has its own pricing, but the self-hosted Desktop and Docker versions are free to use, modify, and deploy commercially. You pay only for whatever LLM API keys you configure (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) — or nothing at all if you use local inference via Ollama.

### Can AnythingLLM run fully offline?

Yes, with the right setup. Pair AnythingLLM with Ollama for local inference, use the bundled LanceDB for vector storage, and configure a local embedding model. The Desktop app can run entirely air-gapped with no internet connection. Docker deployments follow the same pattern — Ollama as a companion container handles all model inference without external API calls.

### How does AnythingLLM compare to Open WebUI for team use?

AnythingLLM is stronger for RAG-heavy workloads with workspace isolation and agent automation. Open WebUI is stronger for chat-first teams who primarily want a polished interface for Ollama model switching. If your team's primary use case is document Q&A across multiple projects with role-based access control, AnythingLLM is the better fit. If you need a ChatGPT replacement with model selection and conversation history, Open WebUI wins on UX.

### What are the minimum hardware requirements for AnythingLLM?

The Desktop app requires only 2GB RAM when using a cloud LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) — the app itself is lightweight. For local inference via Ollama, the GPU matters: a 7B model needs 8GB+ VRAM for acceptable response times (2–3 seconds). CPU-only inference is technically possible but produces 30–60 second responses per query, which makes agent workflows impractical. Docker deployment for a small team recommends 4GB RAM minimum, scaling to 16–32GB for local 7B model inference.

### Does AnythingLLM support MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

Yes, as of Desktop v1.8.0. The MCP integration exposes AnythingLLM workspaces as MCP resources that Claude Desktop and other MCP-aware clients can query. This means your private knowledge base becomes available to AI assistants without switching applications or duplicating document pipelines. Note that MCP support is currently Desktop-only — Docker deployments do not yet expose an MCP server endpoint.
