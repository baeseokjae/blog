Giving an AI agent a raw API key is structurally equivalent to handing your housekeeper a master key with no expiry date, no audit trail, and no way to revoke access to a specific door. Peta fixes this by acting as a control plane that intercepts every credential request, enforces a least-privilege policy, and injects short-lived scoped tokens at runtime — so the agent never sees your actual secrets.

## Why Raw API Keys Are a Structural Risk for AI Agents

Raw API keys given to AI agents represent a fundamentally broken security model, and the breach statistics for 2025 prove it. GitGuardian's 2026 report found that 28,649,024 new secrets were exposed in public GitHub commits in 2025 — a 34% year-over-year increase and the largest annual jump ever recorded. Of those, over 1.2 million were AI-service credentials, with 81% year-over-year growth; 12 of the top 15 fastest-growing leaked secret types were AI services. OpenRouter credential leaks alone grew more than 48x year-over-year as agents used it as a gateway to multiple models through a single shared key. Even Claude Code co-authored commits leaked secrets at roughly double the baseline rate. These numbers expose a systemic failure: the tooling that makes agents useful is also making credential hygiene nearly impossible to enforce through discipline alone. The root problem is structural — raw API keys have no concept of intent, scope, caller identity, or time limit, so any agent that holds one has more power than it needs and no mechanism to prove it used that power appropriately.

### The Three Failure Modes That Keep Repeating

**Overprivileged keys** — developers grant `write:*` or `admin` because it's easier than reading the API docs for fine-grained scopes. The agent gets the minimum access required for the one task it was designed for, plus everything else the scope unlocks.

**No per-agent identity** — a key shared between three agents cannot produce a per-agent audit log. When something goes wrong, you know a key was used, not which agent used it, in which context, triggered by which user.

**No revocation path** — static API keys embedded in environment variables or MCP config files are effectively permanent. Rotating them requires redeploying every system that depends on them and hoping you found all the copies. GitGuardian found 24,008 unique secrets exposed in MCP configuration files alone in 2025.

## What Are Scoped Credentials? (Principle of Least Privilege for Agents)

Scoped credentials are time-limited, capability-constrained tokens issued to a specific agent for a specific task — and revoked automatically when the task ends. They implement the principle of least privilege at the agent level: instead of giving an agent a key that can do everything your account allows, you define a policy that specifies exactly which API calls are permitted, from which agent identity, for how long, and under what conditions. A scoped credential for a GitHub integration might read like this: "allow `repos:read` on repositories matching `org/project-*`, valid for 15 minutes, issued to agent `content-writer-7f3a`, triggered by user `alice@example.com`." That token cannot write code, cannot access other organizations, cannot be replayed after 15 minutes, and produces an audit entry that names the exact agent and human who initiated the workflow.

Scoped credentials are the agent-native equivalent of IAM roles in cloud infrastructure. AWS figured this out for EC2 instances in 2011: don't give a server a static access key, give it an instance role that issues temporary credentials via the metadata service. The same architectural insight applies to AI agents running tool calls in 2026. The difference is that agent workflows are far more dynamic — a single conversation can spawn dozens of tool calls across multiple APIs in seconds — so the scoping and issuance machinery needs to operate at MCP-call granularity, not at deployment time.

### Why OAuth Alone Doesn't Solve This

OAuth handles user-delegated authorization — a human consenting to grant an application access to their account. AI agents introduce a second principal problem: the agent itself needs an identity that is separate from the user it's acting on behalf of and separate from the developer who built it. Most OAuth flows produce a token tied to the user, issued to the application — there's no slot for "which agent instance ran this call." Scoped credential systems like Peta add that missing layer.

## What Is Peta? The Control Plane for MCP

Peta is a credential security platform built specifically for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem, designed to act as a policy-enforcing intermediary between AI agents and the external APIs they call. Where 1Password or HashiCorp Vault solve the problem of storing and distributing secrets to humans and traditional software, Peta addresses the agent-specific challenge: credentials need to be scoped per tool call, audited per agent identity, and never exposed to the model context window at all. According to a 2026 WorkOS analysis, 93% of popular AI agent projects use unscoped API keys with no per-agent identity, no user consent, and no revocation mechanism — Peta exists to fix that default.

Peta positions itself as the MCP control plane: it sits between your agent runtime and the MCP servers that expose tools, intercepts every tool invocation, checks it against a defined policy, injects the appropriate short-lived credential, and logs the outcome. The agent receives a response as if it had called the tool directly; it never sees the underlying API key, OAuth token, or service account credential. Peta currently focuses on teams building production agentic systems where multiple agents operate in multi-tenant environments, where regulatory audit requirements demand per-call traceability, or where the blast radius of a compromised agent needs to be bounded.

## How Peta Works — Vault, Gateway, and Policy Engine

Peta's architecture breaks down into three cooperating subsystems: a secrets vault, an MCP gateway, and a policy engine — each of which addresses a distinct failure mode in the raw-API-key model.

**The vault** stores your actual credentials — API keys, OAuth client secrets, service account tokens — encrypted at rest with vault-level isolation between tenants. Nothing in the vault is ever serialized into an agent's context window or environment variable. The vault is the only system that ever sees plaintext credentials, and it exposes them only to the gateway under policy-controlled conditions.

**The MCP gateway** intercepts tool call requests before they reach the target MCP server. When an agent invokes a tool — say, `github.create_pull_request` — the gateway receives that call, checks the agent's identity, looks up the applicable policy, requests a short-lived credential from the vault, injects it into the outbound request, and forwards the call. The agent sees only the tool response. This interception model means zero code changes are required in most agent runtimes; you point your MCP client at Peta's gateway endpoint instead of directly at the tool server.

**The policy engine** is where scope rules live. Policies are expressed as structured configs that specify: which agent identities are permitted to invoke which tools, under what resource constraints (specific repo names, specific customer IDs), for how long credentials remain valid, and whether human approval is required before execution. The policy engine evaluates these rules at call time, not at deployment time, which means policies can incorporate runtime context — the current user's identity, the task ID, even the specific data being accessed.

## Key Features: Short-Lived Tokens, RBAC/ABAC, Human-in-the-Loop Approvals

Peta's feature set maps directly onto the three recurring failure modes in AI agent credential management — overprivilege, anonymous access, and unrevocable tokens — plus a fourth challenge unique to high-stakes agentic workflows: irreversible actions taken without human review.

**Short-lived tokens with automatic rotation** are Peta's core primitive. Every credential injected by the gateway has a TTL — typically minutes, not days — and is scoped to the specific tool being called. If a token leaks (into logs, into a model response, into a sidecar process), it expires before it can be usefully exploited. Rotation is automatic; the agent runtime never needs to handle credential refresh logic, and there's no window where an expired token causes a silent failure.

**RBAC and ABAC at agent granularity** let you write policies like "agent class `researcher` may call `web_search.query` and `read_file` but not `write_file` or any payment-related tool; agent instance `researcher-7f3a` inherits that class policy plus may additionally call `notion.create_page` for workspace ID `ws_abc123`." Attribute-based rules add context sensitivity: a customer-service agent can only call `crm.update_record` when the record's `customer_id` matches the session's authenticated user.

**Human-in-the-loop approvals via Peta Desk** address the category of agent actions that are legitimate in principle but require a human checkpoint before execution — sending an email to 5,000 customers, merging a pull request to `main`, deleting a database record. Peta Desk is a review interface (available as a web UI and via Slack/Teams integration) that pauses the tool call, surfaces the proposed action and its parameters to a designated approver, and resumes or rejects based on their response. The approval decision is logged alongside the credential issuance, producing a complete chain of custody for the action.

**Audit logs with agent-level attribution** capture every tool call: which agent identity, which tool, which credential was issued, what policy was evaluated, what the outcome was, and — for approved actions — who the human approver was. This produces the per-agent audit trail that shared API keys structurally cannot.

## Peta vs. Competitors (Nango, Aembit, WorkOS, 1Password Secrets)

Comparing Peta to adjacent tools requires being precise about what problem each one solves, because they occupy different positions in the AI agent security stack. No single tool covers all use cases equally well.

| Tool | Primary Use Case | MCP-Native | Per-Agent Identity | HITL Approvals | Scoped Short-Lived Tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Peta** | MCP control plane, agent credential scoping | Yes | Yes | Yes (Peta Desk) | Yes |
| **Nango** | OAuth token storage and refresh for SaaS integrations | No | No | No | No |
| **Aembit** | Workload identity, secrets elimination via SPIFFE/OIDC | No | Partial | No | Yes |
| **WorkOS** | User-facing auth, machine-to-machine tokens for app developers | No | Partial | No | Partial |
| **1Password Secrets** | Human and machine secret storage, CI/CD injection | No | No | No | No |

**Nango** is the lightest option for teams that primarily need OAuth token management — storing, refreshing, and isolating user-delegated tokens across multiple SaaS APIs in a multi-tenant setting. It doesn't intercept MCP calls or issue per-agent scoped credentials; it's a token storage layer, not a policy enforcement point. Choose Nango when your agents authenticate as users via OAuth and you need clean token management without an opinionated platform.

**Aembit** takes the most architecturally aggressive position: eliminate secrets entirely using workload identity (SPIFFE/SVID) and dynamic, context-aware credential issuance. Agents prove their identity through attestation rather than holding a credential at all; the target API receives a short-lived token generated just-in-time. Aembit is the right choice for teams with strong zero-trust infrastructure already in place and a tolerance for the integration complexity that SPIFFE requires. It doesn't have MCP-specific tooling today.

**WorkOS** provides the primitives — machine tokens, scoped API keys, RBAC abstractions — but requires you to build the agent auth layer on top. It's suitable for product teams who want to expose their own APIs to AI agents built by their customers and need a polished auth SDK to do so.

**1Password Secrets** is a high-fidelity secrets vault for humans and CI/CD pipelines. It has no concept of agent identity, no MCP gateway, and no policy engine for runtime scoping. Use it as the upstream store for credentials that Peta (or Aembit) then manages at runtime.

**Pick Peta** when your agents run through MCP, you need per-agent audit trails without building custom infrastructure, and human-in-the-loop approvals are a hard requirement for production.

## Getting Started with Peta — Setup and Integration Guide

Peta's integration path is designed to be minimally invasive: the primary change is redirecting your MCP client configuration to point at Peta's gateway instead of directly at tool servers. Here's the conceptual workflow for getting a secure setup running.

**Step 1: Create an organization and register agents.** In Peta's dashboard, create an organization (tenant), then register the agent identities that will operate within it. Each agent identity gets a unique ID used for policy evaluation and audit logging. Agent IDs can map to specific agent instances, agent classes, or deployment environments — the granularity depends on your policy needs.

**Step 2: Import credentials into the vault.** Move your existing API keys and OAuth tokens into Peta's encrypted vault. For OAuth-based integrations, Peta can initiate the OAuth flow and store the resulting tokens directly. Vault credentials are never exposed outside the gateway; they exist only to be injected at call time.

**Step 3: Define policies.** Write policies in Peta's policy config format, specifying which agent IDs may invoke which MCP tools, under what attribute conditions, and whether any tools require human approval. Start with a permissive read-only policy to validate the integration, then tighten scope.

**Step 4: Redirect MCP client configuration.** Replace tool server endpoints in your MCP client config (e.g., Claude's `claude_desktop_config.json` or your agent runtime's server list) with Peta's gateway endpoints. The gateway is transparent to the agent — it receives standard MCP responses.

**Step 5: Validate with audit logs.** Make a few test tool calls and verify that Peta's audit log captures the expected agent identity, tool name, credential TTL, and policy evaluation result. Confirm that any tools configured for human approval correctly surface in Peta Desk.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "url": "https://gateway.peta.io/mcp/github",
      "headers": {
        "X-Peta-Agent-Id": "content-writer-7f3a",
        "X-Peta-Org-Id": "org_abc123"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration tells Peta's gateway which agent is making the call. The gateway then checks the policy for `content-writer-7f3a`, retrieves the appropriate GitHub credential from the vault (scoped to the permitted repos and operations), and forwards the call.

## AI Agent Credential Security Best Practices for 2026

The credential security problem for AI agents is not primarily a tooling problem — it's a design habits problem. Even teams using Peta or Aembit can misconfigure policies, skip audit log review, or grant overly broad scopes for convenience. These best practices close the gap between having the right infrastructure and using it correctly.

**Treat agent identities as first-class principals in your IAM model.** Don't reuse human user credentials or shared service accounts for agent access. Each distinct agent class — researcher, writer, code-reviewer, customer-service bot — should have its own identity with its own scope. This is the prerequisite for meaningful audit logs and targeted revocation.

**Default to the narrowest possible scope and widen explicitly.** When defining a policy for a new agent, start with read-only access to the specific resources the agent demonstrably needs. Document the business justification for any write permission. The 93% of AI agent projects that use unscoped API keys got there by defaulting to "whatever works" rather than "whatever is sufficient."

**Set credential TTLs shorter than you think necessary.** A 15-minute TTL feels aggressive until you realize that most agent tasks complete in under 60 seconds. A compromised 15-minute token is a nuisance; a compromised 90-day token is an incident. If your agent framework requires longer-lived tokens due to session continuity, use a refresh mechanism rather than extending the TTL.

**Audit logs are only valuable if someone reads them.** Build a weekly review of agent credential usage into your security routine — or better, pipe Peta's audit events into your SIEM and set alerts for anomalous patterns: calls to tools an agent has never used before, unusually high call volumes, calls outside expected business hours.

**Human-in-the-loop gates are not a performance penalty — they're a blast radius limiter.** Configure Peta Desk approvals for any tool that performs irreversible actions: sending bulk communications, deleting records, making financial transactions, merging to production branches. The seconds it takes a human to approve are insurance against an agent misinterpreting a task description and taking an action that costs hours to undo.

**Rotate vault credentials on a schedule, not on incidents.** The correct cadence for rotating the underlying API keys stored in Peta's vault is "regularly" — not "when we think they might be compromised." Monthly rotation of long-lived credentials means that even if a vault credential were somehow extracted, its utility window is bounded.

**Test your revocation path before you need it.** At least once per quarter, simulate a compromised agent: revoke its identity in Peta, verify that all subsequent tool calls from that identity are rejected, and confirm that other agents are unaffected. Revocation is only a feature if the mechanism works when you actually invoke it.

## FAQ

**What is Peta and what problem does it solve for AI agents?**
Peta is an MCP control plane that prevents raw API key exposure in AI agent systems. It intercepts tool calls, enforces least-privilege policies, and injects short-lived scoped credentials at runtime — so agents never see the underlying secrets. It solves the structural problem where 93% of AI agent projects use overprivileged, unrevocable API keys with no per-agent identity.

**How does Peta differ from just using environment variables for API keys?**
Environment variables store static, long-lived credentials that agents can read and potentially leak into logs, model outputs, or memory. Peta's gateway never exposes credentials to the agent at all — it intercepts the MCP tool call, injects the credential on the outbound side, and returns only the tool's response. The agent cannot extract the key even if it tries.

**Does Peta require changes to my agent's code?**
Minimal changes. The primary integration point is your MCP client configuration — you redirect tool server endpoints to Peta's gateway and add your agent ID and org ID as headers. The agent runtime itself doesn't need to import any Peta SDK or change how it makes tool calls. Peta is transparent at the MCP protocol level.

**What happens if Peta's gateway goes down? Do my agents stop working?**
Peta's gateway is in the critical path for every tool call that runs through it, so availability is a core concern. Peta runs its gateway as a high-availability service, but you should evaluate their SLA commitments against your reliability requirements. For locally hosted or highly sensitive deployments, Peta also offers self-hosted gateway options.

**How does Peta handle multi-tenant scenarios where multiple users' agents share infrastructure?**
Peta's vault and policy engine are designed for multi-tenancy from the ground up. Each organization (tenant) has isolated credential storage; policies can include attribute conditions that bind a specific tool call to the authenticated end user's identity, preventing one user's agent from accessing another user's data even if they share the same agent class. This makes Peta well-suited for SaaS products that expose AI agents to their customers.
