Zed is a Rust-powered, GPU-accelerated code editor that starts in 0.12 seconds, renders at 120fps, and ships built-in AI features backed by an open agent protocol. If you care about speed and want a native agentic IDE — not a bolted-on AI plugin — Zed is the most interesting editor to evaluate in 2026.

## What Is Zed and Why Does It Matter in 2026?

Zed is a next-generation code editor built entirely in Rust, founded in 2021 by Nathan Sobo — the creator of GitHub's Atom editor. Unlike VS Code, which runs on Electron and JavaScript, Zed uses a custom GPU-accelerated rendering framework called GPUI that delivers 120fps editing, 0.12-second cold startup times, and 2ms input latency. In January 2026, Zed co-developed the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) with JetBrains — an open, Apache-licensed standard that allows any AI agent to integrate with any editor. This positions Zed not just as a fast editor, but as the first editor architected around the concept of interoperable AI agents. For developers who switched to Cursor for AI but miss the speed and responsiveness of a native editor, Zed represents the most compelling alternative in 2026. It supports Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4, Gemini 3 Flash, DeepSeek, and local models via Ollama — all without vendor lock-in.

## The Rise of Zed: From Atom to Rust-Powered Performance

Zed's origins trace directly to GitHub Atom, the open-source editor that Nathan Sobo led before it was deprecated in 2022. Where Atom was beloved for its hackability but notorious for its sluggishness, Zed was designed from day one to be the opposite: uncompromising performance as a first principle, with collaboration and AI built in at the architecture level rather than added as extensions. The team launched Windows support in January 2025, completing the cross-platform story after macOS and Linux. ACP followed in January 2026, co-announced with JetBrains at a moment when the IDE market is fragmenting rapidly. The progression from Atom to Zed is a direct response to developers who believe that Electron-based editors have hit a performance ceiling that no amount of optimization can overcome — and that the right answer is to rebuild from scratch in a systems language.

## Zed Performance Deep Dive: 120fps GPU Rendering, 0.12s Startup, 2ms Latency

Zed is measurably the fastest code editor available in 2026, with benchmarks that are difficult to dismiss as marketing. Cold startup takes 0.12 seconds compared to VS Code's 1.2 seconds — a 10x difference. Loading a large project takes 0.25 seconds in Zed versus 3.8 seconds in VS Code, a 15x gap. Opening a 50MB file completes in 0.8 seconds versus 3.2 seconds. Idle RAM usage sits between 150–250MB, compared to 300–650MB for VS Code. Input latency — the time between a keystroke and the character appearing on screen — is 2ms in Zed versus 12–25ms in VS Code and Cursor. AI suggestions appear in under 80ms, compared to 150ms for Cursor and 160ms for VS Code with GitHub Copilot. These are not incremental improvements. They represent a fundamentally different performance tier, enabled by GPUI's direct GPU rendering rather than DOM-based layout. For developers working in flow state, 2ms versus 25ms latency is the difference between an editor that feels like an extension of your mind and one that feels like it's lagging behind you.

### Why GPUI Matters for Developers

GPUI is Zed's custom GPU-accelerated UI framework, written in Rust, that renders directly to the GPU rather than going through a browser engine. This is the technical root of every performance advantage Zed has. Traditional Electron-based editors (VS Code, Cursor) must serialize UI updates through a JavaScript event loop, push them through Chromium's rendering pipeline, and then composite them on screen. GPUI bypasses all of that. The result is 120fps editing, meaning the cursor and text always feel instantaneous, and large file scrolling is smooth even on older hardware. For developers who spend 8+ hours a day editing text, this translates to measurably lower cognitive load — something that shows up in flow state metrics even when developers can't consciously articulate what feels different.

## Zed AI Features Review 2026: From Assistants to Agents

Zed AI in 2026 ships four core AI capabilities built directly into the editor: Agentic Editing, Edit Prediction via the Zeta model, an Inline Assistant, and Text Threads. Agentic Editing is the flagship feature — it handles multi-file edits through natural language at 120fps, letting you describe what you want changed across your codebase and having the editor execute it. Edit Prediction uses Zeta, Zed's open-source code completion model, to predict your next edit based on recent context — different from token-level autocomplete, it predicts structural changes. The Inline Assistant surfaces a panel directly in the editor gutter for targeted file-level help. Text Threads offer a plain-text LLM interface for freeform conversation without leaving the editor. All features support multiple model backends: Claude Sonnet 4/4.6, OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-4 Turbo, Anthropic Claude 3 Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, Google Gemini 3 Flash, DeepSeek, and local models via Ollama and LM Studio.

### Edit Prediction with Zeta: Open-Source Code Completion

Zeta is Zed's open-source edit prediction model, distinct from traditional autocomplete. Where autocomplete predicts the next token you'll type, Zeta predicts the next edit you'll make — understanding structural patterns like "you just renamed this function, you probably want to update these three call sites." This is the same paradigm that made Cursor's Tab feature compelling, but Zeta is open-source and runs on infrastructure you control. Edit prediction in Zed appears in under 80ms, which is fast enough that it doesn't interrupt your typing rhythm. For teams that want code completion without sending code to third-party servers, Zeta combined with Ollama for local execution provides a privacy-first alternative to GitHub Copilot.

### Inline Assistant and Text Threads

The Inline Assistant opens a lightweight input directly adjacent to selected code — you highlight a function, type "add error handling for network timeouts," and Zed applies the change inline with a diff preview. Text Threads are persistent, plain-text conversation logs with your LLM of choice, saved as files in your project. This is a deliberate design choice: threads are just text files, which means they're version-controllable, searchable, and shareable with teammates. Unlike panel-based chat interfaces in VS Code extensions, Text Threads don't require a separate sidebar tab — they exist in Zed's standard editor surface.

## The Agent Client Protocol (ACP): A New Standard for IDE-Agent Interoperability

ACP — the Agent Client Protocol — is an open, Apache-licensed standard co-developed by Zed and JetBrains and announced in January 2026. It defines a shared protocol that allows any AI agent to integrate with any supporting editor through a single interface, eliminating the one-off integrations that have fragmented the AI developer tools ecosystem. Before ACP, every agent-editor combination required custom integration work: Cursor built its own editor, GitHub Copilot maintains VS Code and JetBrains plugins separately, Claude Code uses its own terminal interface. ACP replaces this with a universal adapter — an agent that implements ACP gains access to multi-file editing, codebase context, and reviewing tools in every ACP-compliant editor simultaneously. The protocol is privacy-first by design: third-party agents operating via ACP never touch Zed's servers; communication happens directly between the agent and the local editor process. ACP's first major integration was Gemini CLI in August 2025, followed by Claude Code in September 2025, JetBrains partnership and Codex CLI in October 2025, and the formal ACP announcement in January 2026.

### ACP Ecosystem Deep Dive: 20+ Agents, 10+ Editors

As of April 2026, ACP supports more than 20 AI agents and 10+ editor clients. Agents with ACP support include Claude Agent, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Codex CLI, Cursor, Cline, Mistral Vibe, OpenCode, Goose (from Square), Augment Code, Blackbox AI, Kimi CLI, and Qwen Code, among others. Cursor joined the ACP Registry in March 2026 and is now available as an agent inside JetBrains IDEs — a remarkable development given that Cursor is itself a fork of VS Code. Editor clients supporting ACP include Zed (native), JetBrains IDEs (in progress), Neovim (via CodeCompanion and avante.nvim plugins), Emacs (via agent-shell), marimo, AionUI, Obsidian (via plugin), Sidequery (in progress), and web browsers via the AI SDK. The protocol's momentum is significant: the ACP page lists endorsements from Mistral AI ("thoughtfully designed, community-driven, and evolving rapidly") and Augment Code ("developers should be able to use the best AI agent in the workflow that suits them, and ACP makes that possible"). This is the kind of cross-industry alignment that precedes a de facto standard.

## Zed AI vs Cursor vs VS Code + Copilot: Head-to-Head Comparison

| Category | Zed AI | Cursor | VS Code + Copilot |
|---|---|---|---|
| Startup Time | 0.12s | ~1.5s | ~1.2–3.0s |
| Input Latency | 2ms | ~15ms | ~12–25ms |
| Idle RAM | 150–250MB | ~400MB | 300–650MB |
| AI Suggestion Speed | <80ms | ~150ms | ~160ms |
| Multi-File AI Edits | Yes (Agentic) | Yes (Composer) | Limited |
| Codebase Indexing | No | Yes | Yes (with extensions) |
| ACP Support | Native | Via ACP Registry | No |
| Extension Ecosystem | 500–800 | VS Code compatible | 50,000+ |
| Local LLM Support | Yes (Ollama, LM Studio) | Limited | Via extensions |
| Real-Time Collaboration | Native (CRDT) | No | Live Share extension |
| Pricing (AI) | Free BYO / $10/mo | $20/mo | $10/mo (Copilot) |

Zed wins on raw performance across every metric. Cursor wins on codebase-wide AI intelligence, particularly Composer's ability to understand and refactor entire codebases. VS Code wins on extension ecosystem breadth — 50,000+ extensions versus Zed's 500–800. The decision matrix: choose Zed if performance and collaboration matter most, or if you want ACP's agent flexibility. Choose Cursor if you need deep codebase-wide AI edits and are willing to pay the performance tax. Choose VS Code if you depend on specialized language extensions not yet available in Zed.

## Zed AI Pricing: Free BYO Key vs $10/Month vs $20/User Team Plan

Zed AI offers three pricing tiers. The BYO (Bring Your Own) tier is free — you connect your own Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or other API key, and Zed sends requests directly to your provider. You pay only for model API usage, with no additional Zed charge. The individual plan costs $10/month and includes a hosted Claude-powered assistant without needing to manage API keys. The team plan costs $20/user/month and adds shared team workspaces and centralized billing. For developers already paying for Anthropic or OpenAI API access, the BYO tier is compelling: you get Zed's native AI features with your existing API budget and no additional subscription. This contrasts favorably with Cursor at $20/month (required for most AI features) and VS Code + GitHub Copilot at $10/month (but with significantly slower response times). Organizations with privacy requirements benefit most from BYO: code is sent directly to your API provider, never to Zed's servers.

## Local LLM Privacy: Running Ollama and LM Studio in Zed

Zed supports local LLM execution via Ollama and LM Studio, meaning your code never leaves your machine. To configure Ollama in Zed, install Ollama, pull a model (`ollama pull codellama:13b` or `ollama pull deepseek-coder:6.7b`), then add the Ollama provider to Zed's `settings.json` under the `language_models` key. LM Studio works similarly via its local API server, which Zed can target as a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Local models sacrifice some capability compared to hosted Claude Sonnet 4 or GPT-4, but the privacy trade-off is absolute: no network requests, no third-party data retention, no compliance risk for sensitive codebases. For teams operating in air-gapped environments or under strict data governance requirements (healthcare, finance, defense contractors), local LLM support is not a nice-to-have — it's a prerequisite that eliminates most commercial AI editors from consideration. Zed's native support for this workflow without requiring extensions makes it the most practical choice in this category.

## Collaboration Features: CRDT-Based Real-Time Editing

Zed's collaboration system is built on CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) — the same underlying technology used by Google Docs and Figma for real-time collaborative editing. Unlike VS Code Live Share, which routes edits through Microsoft's servers and can introduce latency under poor network conditions, Zed's CRDT implementation operates peer-to-peer, enabling cursor sharing, voice chat, screen sharing, shared terminal sessions, and channel-based project rooms. The technical implication of CRDT versus operational transforms (used by older collaboration systems) is that merge conflicts are mathematically impossible — every concurrent edit resolves deterministically without requiring a conflict resolution step. For distributed teams doing pair programming or code review sessions, this makes Zed's native collaboration noticeably more reliable than VS Code Live Share in practice. The collaboration features are included in all Zed tiers, not paywalled behind a team subscription.

## Who Should Use Zed in 2026?

The right Zed user in 2026 falls into one of four profiles. Performance-first developers who have grown frustrated with Electron-based editor sluggishness will find the jump to 0.12s startup and 2ms latency immediately rewarding. Collaboration-focused teams doing regular pair programming will benefit from native CRDT-based real-time editing without the Live Share plugin dependency. Privacy-conscious developers at organizations with data governance requirements will value the BYO key model and local LLM support. And early adopters of the ACP ecosystem who want to run Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or Cursor as agents inside a fast native editor will find Zed the most mature ACP-native client available. Zed is not the right choice for developers heavily invested in VS Code's extension ecosystem, particularly those using specialized language servers, debuggers, or platform-specific tooling not yet available in Zed's 500–800 extension catalog. Python developers will need to manually configure basedpyright and Ruff, as Python tooling requires more setup than in VS Code.

## Current Limitations: Extension Ecosystem, Debugging, Settings Sync

Zed's limitations in 2026 are real and should inform your decision. The extension ecosystem has 500–800 extensions versus VS Code's 50,000+ — this gap is large enough that specific workflows (certain language servers, cloud provider tools, niche framework plugins) may not yet have Zed equivalents. DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol) debugging support is limited; complex debugging workflows that VS Code handles seamlessly may require workarounds or command-line debugging instead. Settings sync across machines is not yet supported natively — you'll need to manage your `settings.json` manually or via a dotfiles system. Several AI features are paywalled behind the $10/month plan and not available in the BYO tier. Zed also lacks codebase-wide indexing for AI, meaning it can't answer questions like "find all usages of this pattern across the entire repository" the way Cursor Composer can. These are known gaps the Zed team is actively working on, but they represent real friction for developers migrating from VS Code today.

## Getting Started with Zed and ACP: Setup Guide

Getting Zed running with AI takes under five minutes. Download Zed from zed.dev, launch it, and open the AI panel with `Cmd+Shift+A` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+A` (Linux/Windows). For BYO key setup, open `settings.json` via `Cmd+,` and add your provider's API key under `language_models`. To use Ollama locally, ensure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`) and add `"ollama": {"api_url": "http://localhost:11434"}` to your language model configuration. For ACP, install an ACP-compatible agent like Claude Code or Gemini CLI, then connect it to Zed via the ACP endpoint that Zed exposes on localhost. The ACP connection gives the external agent access to your full editor context — open files, diagnostics, and multi-file editing capabilities — while keeping the agent process entirely separate from Zed itself. JetBrains users can run the same agents via JetBrains' ACP implementation, making agent-switching between IDEs seamless.

## FAQ

**Is Zed free to use in 2026?**
Yes. Zed the editor is free and open source. Zed AI is also free if you bring your own API key from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or another supported provider. The $10/month individual plan provides a hosted Claude-powered assistant without requiring you to manage API keys separately.

**What is ACP and how does it differ from MCP?**
ACP (Agent Client Protocol) is a standard for connecting AI agents to editors — it defines how an agent can read files, make edits, and understand codebase context via the IDE. MCP (Model Context Protocol) is Anthropic's standard for connecting LLMs to external data sources and tools. They operate at different layers: MCP provides context to models, ACP provides agent capabilities to editors. They can work together.

**Can Zed replace Cursor in 2026?**
For most workflows, partially. Zed is faster and has native ACP support, but lacks Cursor Composer's codebase-wide indexing and multi-file refactoring intelligence. If you use Cursor mainly for inline edits and chat, Zed with ACP-connected Claude Code covers that well. If you rely heavily on Composer for large-scale refactors, Cursor is still stronger.

**Does Zed work on Windows?**
Yes. Zed launched Windows support in January 2025. It's available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, though the macOS version has the longest track record and most community extensions.

**How do I run local LLMs in Zed without sending code to the cloud?**
Install Ollama or LM Studio on your machine and start the local server. In Zed's `settings.json`, configure the provider to point to the local endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:11434` for Ollama). Zed will route all AI requests to your local model. No code leaves your machine. Models like DeepSeek Coder 6.7B and CodeLlama 13B work well for code completion; larger models like DeepSeek 33B provide better reasoning for complex tasks.
