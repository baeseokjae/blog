Cursor 3, released April 2, 2026, is the most significant update to the AI IDE since its founding — it ships an Agents Window for orchestrating multiple AI agents in parallel, a Design Mode for visual-to-code workflows, and the Composer 2 model that scores 73.7 on SWE-bench Multilingual. If you're using Cursor daily, these three features alone change how you structure your entire development workflow.

## What Is Cursor 3 and What's New?

Cursor 3 is the third major generation of Anysphere's AI-powered IDE, released on April 2, 2026. It introduces three architectural shifts that move Cursor from an AI autocomplete tool into a multi-agent coding platform. The headline feature is the **Agents Window** — a dedicated, standalone interface for spinning up, monitoring, and managing multiple AI agents running simultaneously on different tasks. Unlike Cursor's earlier Agent Mode, which handled one task per conversation, the Agents Window lets you dispatch parallel agents with isolated git worktrees, each working on separate branches without stepping on each other. Cursor 3 also ships **Design Mode**, which accepts Figma designs, screenshots, or rough sketches and converts them into production-ready component code. And it bundles **Composer 2**, Anysphere's first proprietary frontier model, trained end-to-end for agentic coding workflows inside the IDE. By February 2026, Cursor had crossed $2B annualized revenue and reached 1M+ daily active users — making Cursor 3 one of the most consequential IDE releases in recent memory.

### Cursor 3 vs Cursor 2: Key Differences

| Feature | Cursor 2 | Cursor 3 |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-agent interface | None (single conversation) | Agents Window (parallel, monitored) |
| AI model | External models (Claude, GPT-5) | Composer 2 + external models |
| Design-to-code | Not available | Design Mode (Figma, screenshots) |
| Cloud agents | Beta (limited) | GA with Computer Use |
| Context window | Varies by model | 200K (Composer 2) |
| Background agents | Early access | Fully GA across all paid plans |

## How Does the Agents Window Work?

The Agents Window is a standalone panel inside the Cursor IDE that acts as a control center for all your running agents. It is purpose-built for parallel execution — each agent you launch through the window gets its own isolated git worktree, meaning it checks out a separate copy of your repository, works independently, and pushes results as a pull request without conflicting with your main branch or other agents. You can monitor every agent's live progress, intervene with instructions mid-run, or kill a task that's going off-track — all from a single, unified view.

To use it: open the Agents Window from the sidebar, describe your task in plain English (e.g., "write integration tests for the auth module"), choose your model, and hit Run. Cursor spins up a cloud VM, gives it access to your codebase and the shell, and the agent begins working asynchronously. You can switch to a completely different task in your main editor while your agents run. When they finish, results appear as PRs in your linked GitHub repository. According to Cursor's internal data, 35% of their own merged PRs are now created by background agents — a figure that illustrates how seriously even the Cursor team dogfoods this workflow.

### Setting Up Your First Agent in the Agents Window

Getting started with the Agents Window requires a Pro plan ($20/month) or higher — the Hobby tier does not include agent access. Setup steps:

1. **Connect your repository**: Cursor needs GitHub OAuth to create PRs from agent runs. Go to Settings → Integrations → GitHub.
2. **Open the Agents Window**: Click the robot icon in the left sidebar or use `Cmd+Shift+A`.
3. **Write a task description**: Be specific. "Add unit tests for UserService.ts targeting the login and logout methods" works far better than "write tests."
4. **Select your model**: Composer 2 (default), Claude Opus 4.6, or GPT-5.4 depending on the task complexity and cost tolerance.
5. **Review Privacy Mode**: Background agents require Privacy Mode to be disabled. Enterprise plans get dedicated infrastructure to compensate.
6. **Hit Run and switch context**: The agent runs asynchronously. You'll get a notification (or GitHub PR) when it's done.

## What Are Cursor Parallel Agents?

Cursor parallel agents are multiple AI coding agents running simultaneously on separate, isolated branches of your repository. Cursor 3 makes parallel execution the default pattern for multi-task workflows, removing the friction of manually coordinating sequential tasks. Each parallel agent operates in its own git worktree — a native git feature that Cursor manages automatically — so agents working on a bug fix, a new feature, and a test suite can run concurrently without file conflicts. Parallel agents are available both locally (through Agent Mode with worktrees enabled) and remotely (through the Agents Window with cloud VMs). The productivity math is compelling: if each task takes 20 minutes for an AI agent, running 5 in parallel compresses what would be 100 minutes of sequential work into 20 minutes of wall-clock time.

### Native Worktree Support for Parallel Agents

Cursor 3 adds native worktree management — previously you had to set up git worktrees manually. Now when you launch multiple agents from the Agents Window, Cursor automatically:

- Creates a new worktree for each agent under `.git/worktrees/`
- Checks out a dedicated branch (e.g., `agent/fix-auth-bug-2026-04-18`)
- Gives each agent independent file system access with no shared state
- Merges results back via pull requests after you review

You can also run models in parallel on the same task — useful for hard problems where you want to compare a Composer 2 solution against a Claude Opus 4.6 solution side by side before picking the better approach.

### When to Use Parallel Agents vs Sequential Agent Mode

| Scenario | Use Parallel Agents | Use Sequential Agent Mode |
|---|---|---|
| Well-defined, isolated tasks | ✅ | — |
| Tasks that share context or files | — | ✅ |
| Bug fixes across multiple modules | ✅ | — |
| Exploratory refactoring | — | ✅ |
| Writing tests for known functions | ✅ | — |
| Architecture design decisions | — | ✅ |
| Generating boilerplate in parallel | ✅ | — |

## What Is Cursor Design Mode?

Cursor Design Mode is a visual-to-code feature in Cursor 3 that accepts design inputs — Figma file URLs, screenshots, wireframes, or rough sketches — and converts them into working component code. It is not a low-fidelity mockup generator. Design Mode analyzes your existing codebase, identifies the component library you're already using (React, Vue, Tailwind, Shadcn, etc.), and generates new components that match both the visual design and your existing code conventions. For teams where designers and developers work in Figma, Design Mode removes the translation step: instead of a developer manually recreating a design pixel-by-pixel, the agent reads the Figma structure and writes the component directly. In an internal test by Bolder Apps, Design Mode reduced time-to-implementation for a standard card component from ~90 minutes to under 5 minutes, including QA review of the generated code.

### How to Use Design Mode

1. **Open Design Mode**: Press `Cmd+D` or click the Design icon in the top bar.
2. **Paste a Figma URL or upload an image**: Design Mode supports Figma URLs (requires Figma read token), screenshots, or even hand-drawn wireframes photographed on your phone.
3. **Specify your target framework**: Type "React with Tailwind CSS" or let Cursor infer from your codebase.
4. **Review the proposed component**: Design Mode generates a preview alongside the code, so you can compare before accepting.
5. **Accept or iterate**: Click Accept to insert the component into your file, or give feedback ("make the button larger," "use our existing Button component instead") for an immediate revision.

Design Mode works best when your codebase has a consistent component pattern for it to learn from. Drop in a few examples of your existing components in the chat context (`@Button.tsx @Card.tsx`) before running Design Mode on a new design for dramatically better output quality.

## Cursor Composer 2: The Model Behind Cursor 3

Composer 2 is Anysphere's first proprietary frontier model, released March 19, 2026 — twelve days before the Cursor 3 update shipped. It is the only frontier coding model built exclusively for an IDE workflow: it cannot be accessed via external API and is only available inside Cursor. Technically, it is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture built on Kimi K2.5 (Moonshot AI's open-source base) with Cursor's continued pretraining and reinforcement learning layered on top. The result is a model that scores 61.7 on Terminal-Bench 2.0 (beating Claude Opus 4.6 at 58.0), 73.7 on SWE-bench Multilingual, and 61.3 on CursorBench — the last being Cursor's own benchmark for IDE-native workflows. It is also 86% cheaper than Composer 1.5: Standard tier costs $0.50/M input tokens and $2.50/M output, compared to $3.50/M and $17.50/M for v1.5.

### Composer 2 Benchmarks vs Competitors

| Model | Terminal-Bench 2.0 | SWE-bench Multilingual | CursorBench |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPT-5.4 | 75.1 | — | — |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | — | 80.9% | — |
| Composer 2 | 61.7 | 73.7 | 61.3 |
| Claude Opus 4.6 | 58.0 | — | — |
| Composer 1.5 | 47.9 | 65.9 | 44.2 |

Composer 2's standout feature for long-running agent tasks is **compaction-in-the-loop RL**: during training, the model learned to compress its own memory from 5,000+ tokens down to ~1,000 tokens, reducing compaction errors by 50%. In practice this means Composer 2 can handle tasks requiring hundreds of sequential actions — large migrations, codebase-wide refactors — without losing context or hallucinating about state that was pushed out of its window.

### Composer 2 Pricing Tiers

| Tier | Input $/M | Output $/M | Cache Read $/M |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard | $0.50 | $2.50 | $0.20 |
| Fast (default) | $1.50 | $7.50 | $0.35 |
| Composer 1.5 (prev) | $3.50 | $17.50 | $0.35 |

Standard mode is slower but 3x cheaper per token. For background agents on non-urgent tasks, Standard is the obvious choice. Fast mode is worth it for interactive development where latency matters.

## Cursor 3 Pricing: Which Plan Do You Need?

Cursor 3 is available across five plans, with parallel agents and the Agents Window gated at Pro and above. The Hobby (free) plan gives you a taste of Agent Mode but does not include cloud background agents or unlimited Composer 2 usage. For individual developers who plan to use parallel agents regularly, **Ultra at $200/month** is the most economical option per credit — it includes the highest monthly agent allocation and is the level where Cursor's own engineers operate day-to-day.

| Plan | Price | Agents Window | Cloud Agents | Composer 2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hobby | Free | ❌ | ❌ | Limited |
| Pro | $20/mo | ✅ | ✅ | Pooled allocation |
| Pro+ | $60/mo | ✅ | ✅ | Expanded allocation |
| Ultra | $200/mo | ✅ | ✅ | Best value per credit |
| Teams | $40/user/mo | ✅ | ✅ | Per-seat allocation |
| Enterprise | Custom | ✅ | ✅ | Dedicated infrastructure |

Important cost note: background agents always run in MAX mode, which carries a 20% surcharge on credit costs. Developers who run agents heavily report spending $60–$100/month all-in at the Pro tier once overages are accounted for. If you're running 10+ agents per day, Pro+ or Ultra is more cost-predictable.

## Cloud Agents with Computer Use

Cloud Agents with Computer Use launched on February 24, 2026 — a month before Cursor 3. Each cloud agent now gets a full remote VM with a browser, video recording, and screenshot capability. This means agents can not only write code but also visually verify it: spin up a dev server, open Chrome, navigate to the component, take a screenshot to confirm it renders correctly, then push the PR. The video recording gives you a full replay of everything the agent did — invaluable for debugging when an agent produces unexpected output.

To enable Computer Use: go to Settings → Agents → Enable Computer Use. Note that Privacy Mode must be disabled, which is the main friction point for enterprises in regulated industries. Cursor handles this with dedicated tenant infrastructure on Enterprise plans, where code never touches shared compute.

## Best Practices for Cursor 3 Agents

After using Cursor 3 parallel agents in production for a month, these patterns consistently produce the best results:

**Write specific, verifiable prompts.** "Add error handling" fails. "Add try/catch around the Stripe API call in `payments/checkout.ts` and log errors with the existing Winston logger" succeeds. The more testable your description, the better the agent performs.

**Use Plan Mode first on complex tasks.** Press `Shift+Tab` before an agent starts coding. It switches the agent into research mode — it reads your codebase, asks clarifying questions, and proposes an implementation plan before writing a single line. Save the plan to `.cursor/plans/` so you can resume interrupted work.

**Leverage `.cursor/rules/` for team standards.** Drop your coding conventions, error handling patterns, and architectural constraints into rules files. Every agent conversation loads these automatically — you never have to re-explain "always use our BaseRepository pattern" across hundreds of agent sessions.

**Batch background tasks, don't run them ad hoc.** The 20% MAX surcharge hurts if you run one background agent for every small change. Instead, batch 5–10 related tasks, run them in parallel, then review the PRs in bulk. This amortizes the VM spin-up overhead and makes code review more efficient.

**Review everything before merging.** 45% of AI-generated code samples contain security vulnerabilities. Cursor's agents are powerful, but mandatory human review before merging to main is non-negotiable. Use GitHub's code review tools, run your test suite, and treat agent PRs like any other contributor's output.

## Cursor 3 vs Competitors in 2026

| Feature | Cursor 3 | Google Antigravity | Claude Code | GitHub Copilot |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Agents Window | ✅ Agents Window | ✅ Manager View | ✅ Terminal-native | ❌ |
| Parallel agents | ✅ Native worktrees | ✅ 5 simultaneous | ✅ Worktrees | ❌ |
| Design Mode | ✅ Figma/screenshots | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Proprietary model | ✅ Composer 2 | ❌ (Gemini 3.1/Claude) | ✅ Claude Opus 4.6 | ❌ (GPT-5) |
| Context window | 200K | 2M | 200K | 128K |
| Free tier | ✅ (limited) | ✅ (full) | ❌ (API costs) | ✅ (limited) |
| MCP plugins | ✅ Marketplace | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Pricing | $0–$200/mo | Free | Pay-per-token | $10–$39/mo |

Google Antigravity is the most formidable Cursor 3 competitor in 2026 — it's free, includes full Gemini 3.1 Pro and Claude Opus 4.6 access, and offers a 2M token context window (10x Cursor's 200K). Antigravity's weak points are its lack of MCP support and a less mature plugin ecosystem. Cursor 3's MCP marketplace, Design Mode, and the Agents Window give it a meaningful lead for teams already invested in the Cursor workflow.

## FAQ

**What is the Cursor 3 Agents Window?**
The Agents Window is a dedicated panel in Cursor 3 for launching, monitoring, and managing multiple AI agents running in parallel. Each agent gets an isolated git worktree and outputs results as pull requests. It launched with the Cursor 3 update on April 2, 2026, and is available on Pro plans and above.

**Can I use Design Mode with existing component libraries?**
Yes. Design Mode analyzes your codebase to detect which component library you're using (Tailwind, Shadcn, Material UI, etc.) and generates new components that match your existing patterns. For best results, include a few of your existing components in the chat context before running Design Mode.

**How many parallel agents can I run simultaneously in Cursor 3?**
The number of simultaneous agents depends on your plan tier. Pro users can run multiple background agents, with higher allocations on Pro+, Ultra, and Teams plans. Enterprise plans support organization-wide concurrent agent usage with dedicated infrastructure.

**Is Composer 2 available via external API?**
No. Composer 2 is exclusively available inside the Cursor IDE and cannot be accessed via API. It is the only frontier coding model with no external API access — a deliberate choice by Anysphere to optimize it for IDE-native workflows including file editing, shell execution, and browser control.

**How much does running background agents actually cost?**
Background agents always run in MAX mode, which adds a 20% surcharge on credit costs. Developers who run agents heavily typically spend $60–$100/month all-in at the Pro tier ($20/month base). If you're running 10 or more agents per day, Pro+ ($60/month) or Ultra ($200/month) is more cost-predictable than paying overages on Pro.
