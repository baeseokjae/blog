JetBrains Air is a multi-agent development environment that lets you run Codex, Claude, Gemini, and Junie simultaneously on different tasks — not another AI code editor, but an orchestration layer that sits above your existing IDE. Launched as a free public preview in March 2026 for macOS, Air is JetBrains' answer to the question every enterprise developer team is wrestling with: how do you coordinate multiple AI agents without constant context-switching?

## What Is JetBrains Air? The New Agentic Development Environment Explained

JetBrains Air is an agentic development environment designed to orchestrate multiple AI coding agents from a single dashboard, allowing teams to run parallel AI workflows across isolated Git worktrees and Docker containers simultaneously. Unlike Cursor (a VS Code fork with built-in AI) or GitHub Copilot (a plugin layer), Air doesn't replace your code editor — IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and WebStorm continue as your primary editing surface, while Air manages the agents working alongside you. Launched in public preview in March 2026, Air is currently macOS-only with Windows and Linux versions in development.

The key technical differentiator is ACP — the Agent Client Protocol — an open standard JetBrains developed as a universal connector between IDEs and AI agents, analogous to how LSP (Language Server Protocol) standardized language intelligence tooling in the 2010s. ACP means any compliant agent — Codex, Claude Agent, Gemini CLI, or third-party agents — can plug into Air without vendor-specific adapters. By April 2026, 11% of developers worldwide use JetBrains AI Assistant and/or Junie (9% AI Assistant, 5% Junie), and JetBrains tools are embedded in 88 of the Fortune Global Top 100 companies, giving Air an unusually large and enterprise-weighted installed base to grow from. Air is built on the codebase of JetBrains Fleet — the collaborative IDE JetBrains discontinued in 2024 — a pragmatic reuse that drew skepticism but accelerated Air's development by roughly 18 months.

## Key Features: Multi-Agent Orchestration with Codex, Claude, Gemini, and Junie

JetBrains Air's multi-agent orchestration layer is what separates it from every other AI coding tool available in 2026. The core capability is running four distinct agents — OpenAI Codex, Anthropic's Claude Agent, Google Gemini CLI, and JetBrains' own Junie — simultaneously on separate tasks from a unified dashboard, with real-time status updates showing which agent is working on what file and what it has changed.

Out of the box, Air ships with native support for Codex, Claude Agent, Gemini CLI, and Junie. Each agent runs in isolation: you assign it a task (e.g., "migrate the auth module to the new JWT library"), a Git worktree as its sandbox, and optionally a Docker container for environment isolation. Air's dashboard shows all active agents on a single screen — their current status, the files they've touched, and any blocking errors. Junie, JetBrains' own agent ($10/month individual, $60/month enterprise), integrates most deeply with IntelliJ-family IDEs and has access to the full project model, meaning it understands imports, type hierarchies, and test coverage in ways external agents don't. Air also integrates MCP (Model Context Protocol) for connecting external tools and data sources — databases, Jira, Confluence, internal APIs — so agents can query real context rather than hallucinating project structure. BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) support means developers who already pay for Anthropic or OpenAI API access can plug those keys in and use Air at no additional cost beyond their existing API spend.

### How ACP Changes Agent Integration

ACP (Agent Client Protocol) is JetBrains' bid to become the standard connector between development environments and AI agents — built on the same philosophy as LSP but for the agentic layer. With ACP, any compliant agent can register its capabilities with Air and receive structured task assignments, file context, and progress reporting channels. The practical result: adding a new agent to your Air workflow doesn't require reading vendor documentation or writing adapter code — if the agent is ACP-compliant, it appears in the Air agent registry and is ready to assign tasks.

## How Air Works: Docker Containers, Git Worktrees, and Parallel Agent Isolation

JetBrains Air uses Git worktrees and Docker containers to prevent parallel agents from stepping on each other's changes — a technical approach that directly addresses the biggest risk in multi-agent development: conflicting edits. Each agent operates in its own Git worktree, a standard Git feature that creates a separate working directory from the same repository, so Agent A working on the auth module and Agent B writing tests never touch the same filesystem state simultaneously. Docker containers add an additional isolation layer for agents that need different runtime environments — useful when migrating legacy code where the old and new environments can't coexist.

A practical example from the official Air documentation: migrate a legacy module to a new framework in one Git worktree with Claude Agent, while Junie generates a test suite in a second worktree — both monitored from Air's single dashboard. When both agents finish, Air surfaces the diffs for review and handles the merge. The workflow reduces context-switching from "alt-tab between three terminal windows" to "review two diffs on one screen." The limitation is real: three or more agents touching related files can still produce merge conflicts that Air surfaces but doesn't automatically resolve. Air handles parallel agent management better than manual tool-switching, but it doesn't eliminate merge conflict review — it just consolidates it. The orchestration layer also adds some latency: spinning up isolated worktrees and Docker containers takes 10–30 seconds per agent depending on repo size, which offsets parallelism gains on small, fast tasks.

### Air's Dashboard: What You Actually See

The Air dashboard presents active agents as cards showing: current task description, files modified (with diff counts), elapsed time, blocking errors, and a "review changes" button that opens a unified diff view. You can pause an agent mid-task, redirect it with additional context, or cancel and discard changes — all from the dashboard without switching to a terminal. There's no built-in code editor in Air; it integrates with your existing JetBrains IDE via ACP, so clicking "open in editor" on a diff launches IntelliJ or PyCharm with the affected files already staged.

## JetBrains Air Pricing: Free with BYOK, or Bundled with AI Subscriptions

JetBrains Air is free to use during its public preview period with BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) — developers who already have Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google API keys can connect them directly, making Air's incremental cost zero beyond existing API spend. For teams without pre-existing API accounts, Air is bundled with JetBrains AI Pro and AI Ultimate subscriptions, the same plans that include Junie and JetBrains AI Assistant access for IntelliJ-family IDEs.

| Plan | Air Access | Junie Included | Best For |
|------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **BYOK (Free)** | Full Air features | No (use external agents) | Developers with Claude/GPT-4 API keys |
| **AI Pro** | Bundled | Yes (individual tier) | Individual developers, $10/month Junie add-on |
| **AI Ultimate** | Bundled | Yes (enterprise tier) | Teams, up to $60/month Junie |

The pricing structure is genuinely developer-friendly: if you already pay for Claude API or OpenAI API access (which many senior developers do), Air costs nothing additional. The catch is that Junie — the agent with deepest IntelliJ integration and project model awareness — requires a separate JetBrains subscription. For teams already using JetBrains AI Pro, Air is a no-brainer upgrade that lands in the same subscription at no extra cost.

### Hidden Cost: API Token Consumption

Running three agents in parallel means three simultaneous API streams consuming tokens. A complex refactor that takes 20 minutes with one agent running three agents in parallel doesn't cost 20 minutes × 1 agent — it costs 20 minutes × 3 agents' token burn. Teams switching to Air from single-agent workflows should budget for 2–3× API cost increase when running parallel sessions, offset (partially) by faster wall-clock completion times.

## JetBrains Air vs Cursor vs GitHub Copilot: Which Agentic Setup Wins in 2026?

JetBrains Air, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot occupy distinct positions in the 2026 AI development tool market, and they're not direct substitutes — the "right" choice depends heavily on your workflow, existing tooling, and project type. Air excels at large-scale, cross-file work where parallel agents add genuine value. Cursor wins at single-file deep work with its embedded chat and diff UI. Copilot Workspace sits in between: agentic planning with GitHub-native integration but without Air's parallel execution.

| Feature | JetBrains Air | Cursor | GitHub Copilot Workspace |
|---------|--------------|--------|------------------------|
| **Agent parallelism** | Yes (multiple simultaneous) | No (sequential) | Partial (planned tasks) |
| **Supported agents** | Codex, Claude, Gemini, Junie | Claude 3.5, GPT-4o | Copilot only |
| **Code editor** | No (uses your JetBrains IDE) | Yes (VS Code fork) | No (GitHub UI) |
| **BYOK** | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Git worktree isolation** | Yes (native) | No | No |
| **macOS/Windows/Linux** | macOS only (2026 preview) | All platforms | All platforms |
| **Pricing entry point** | Free (BYOK) | $20/month | $10/month (Copilot) |

The honest verdict: Air is best for greenfield development and large cross-cutting refactors — cases where running a migration agent alongside a test-writing agent saves hours. Cursor remains better for precision single-file work, particularly when you want tight inline diff review. GitHub Copilot Workspace wins for teams already deep in the GitHub ecosystem who want agentic task planning without leaving GitHub's UI.

For teams that use IntelliJ, PyCharm, or WebStorm as their primary IDE, Air is the most natural extension path — it doesn't ask you to change your editor, just to add an orchestration layer on top.

## Real-World Use Cases: When Air Shines (and When It Doesn't)

JetBrains Air delivers its clearest value on tasks that are large enough to justify parallelism and structured enough that agent isolation prevents conflicts — specifically, large module migrations, framework upgrades, and test suite generation against existing code. For a concrete example: migrating a 15,000-line Java monolith's data access layer from Hibernate 5 to JPA 3 while simultaneously generating a regression test suite is a task that takes one developer 3–5 days sequentially. With Air running Claude Agent on the migration and Junie on the test generation in separate worktrees, the wall-clock time drops to 1–2 days of combined agent time plus human review — a meaningful gain.

Where Air underperforms: precise debugging sessions, performance profiling, or any task requiring tight human-in-the-loop iteration. These workflows benefit from low latency and direct code feedback — areas where Cursor's embedded inline chat and diff system outperforms Air's dashboard-and-review approach. The orchestration layer adds overhead (worktree setup, agent initialization, diff consolidation) that is invisible cost on a 3-hour task and significant cost on a 15-minute task. Air also struggled in testing on large monorepos where agents needed shared context — when Agent A's changes needed to inform Agent B's decisions, the isolation that prevents conflicts also prevents knowledge transfer, requiring manual coordination that partially offsets parallelism gains.

### Who Should Use Air Today

- **Java/Kotlin teams on IntelliJ**: highest value — Junie's deep project model integration is unique to JetBrains IDEs
- **Python teams on PyCharm**: strong fit for data pipeline rewrites and library migration tasks
- **Enterprise teams with existing JetBrains subscriptions**: Air is essentially free, so evaluation cost is zero
- **Developers with existing Claude or GPT-4 API keys**: BYOK makes Air zero additional cost

Hold off if you primarily work on single-file features, do a lot of exploratory debugging, or your team is primarily on VS Code — Air's complement-not-replace positioning means VS Code users get less value since the JetBrains IDE integration layer (the main benefit over raw CLI agents) doesn't apply.

## Should You Switch to JetBrains Air in 2026? Verdict for Java, Python, and Web Devs

JetBrains Air earns a cautious recommendation for development teams already inside the JetBrains ecosystem, with a stronger recommendation specifically for Java and Kotlin teams where Junie's IntelliJ integration is a genuine differentiator. The core value proposition — run multiple agents in parallel on isolated worktrees, review consolidated diffs from one dashboard — is real and demonstrably useful for large refactors and migrations. The public preview limitations (macOS only, occasional orchestration latency, no automatic merge conflict resolution) are real friction points but are preview-stage issues rather than fundamental design flaws.

The BYOK pricing is the strongest selling point for developer adoption: if you're already paying for Claude or GPT-4 API access, Air costs nothing to try. The risk is low; the upside for enterprise teams on JetBrains licenses is high. JetBrains' decision to build Air on the Fleet codebase rather than start from scratch is pragmatic — it accelerated release by months — but the lingering concern is whether JetBrains will maintain long-term commitment to Air given Fleet's abandonment. The ACP standard mitigates this risk somewhat: if Air's orchestration layer ever winds down, ACP-compliant agents can integrate with other surfaces. For non-JetBrains IDE users (VS Code, Neovim, Emacs), Air in its current form is a poor fit. The editor integration layer is the key differentiator, and without it, Air is just a dashboard for managing CLI agents you could run yourself. Wait for broader IDE support before evaluating.

**Bottom line**: If you use IntelliJ or PyCharm, have JetBrains AI Pro, and your team regularly tackles large cross-cutting changes, deploy Air in the next sprint. If you're a VS Code team or primarily do feature-level work, revisit when Windows/Linux support and third-party IDE plugins land — likely Q3 2026.

## FAQ

JetBrains Air is a new product category — multi-agent development environment — and the questions developers ask most often center on pricing, platform support, the ACP standard, and how Air compares to tools they already use. The five questions below address the most common points of confusion based on developer forums, Reddit threads, and official documentation reviewed during the April 2026 research period. Key facts: Air is free to use with your own API keys (BYOK), currently macOS-only, built around the ACP open standard, and does not replace your existing JetBrains IDE — it adds an orchestration layer on top. For teams already paying for JetBrains AI Pro or Claude/GPT-4 API access, the incremental cost to try Air is zero, which makes evaluation low-risk even if your team ultimately sticks with Cursor or Copilot Workspace for most work.

### Is JetBrains Air free?

JetBrains Air is free during public preview for macOS with BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) — bring your own Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google API keys and there's no additional charge. For teams without pre-existing API keys, Air is bundled with JetBrains AI Pro and AI Ultimate subscriptions alongside Junie and JetBrains AI Assistant.

### What is ACP (Agent Client Protocol) in JetBrains Air?

ACP is an open standard developed by JetBrains for connecting AI coding agents to development environments — analogous to how LSP (Language Server Protocol) standardized language intelligence integration. ACP allows any compliant agent (Codex, Claude, Gemini, or third-party) to register capabilities with Air and receive structured task assignments without vendor-specific adapter code.

### Does JetBrains Air replace Cursor or VS Code?

No. JetBrains Air explicitly does not include a code editor and is designed to complement IntelliJ-family IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm), not replace them. Cursor is a VS Code fork with a built-in AI layer — a different architecture targeting different workflows. Air is an orchestration layer for multi-agent parallel development; Cursor is a tight inline AI editing experience.

### What agents does JetBrains Air support?

JetBrains Air natively supports OpenAI Codex, Anthropic Claude Agent, Google Gemini CLI, and JetBrains' own Junie agent. Additional ACP-compliant agents can be added through the Air agent registry. MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration allows agents to connect with external tools, databases, and data sources.

### Is JetBrains Air available on Windows and Linux?

As of April 2026, JetBrains Air is macOS-only in public preview. JetBrains has confirmed Windows and Linux versions are in development but has not announced a specific release date. Teams on Windows or Linux should monitor the JetBrains roadmap for platform availability updates.
