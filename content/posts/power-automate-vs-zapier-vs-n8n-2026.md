At 10,000 monthly workflow executions, n8n costs $20 and Zapier costs $399. At 100,000 executions, n8n cloud is $50 and Zapier is $799 — and self-hosted n8n is near zero beyond infrastructure. These are not edge cases; they are the numbers enterprise automation teams hit within months of scaling. Power Automate complicates the picture further: it is often free for M365 enterprise customers who already pay Microsoft, making it the default for Fortune 500 IT departments even when Zapier or n8n would work better technically. Here is the honest breakdown of all three.

## Power Automate vs Zapier vs n8n at a Glance

The three platforms target fundamentally different buyer profiles. Power Automate is Microsoft's internal automation product, bundled with M365 and optimized for the Microsoft stack. Zapier is the broadest integration network with 8,000+ apps designed for non-technical business users. n8n is the developer-first, self-hostable platform that wins on cost at scale and compliance requirements. Understanding which category your team falls into answers 80% of the decision.

| | Power Automate | Zapier | n8n |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pricing model** | Per-user ($15/mo) or per-flow ($100/flow) | Per task (each step counts) | Per execution (whole workflow) |
| **Free tier** | Included in M365 plans | 100 tasks/month | 200 executions/month |
| **Self-hosting** | No | No | Yes (AGPLv3) |
| **Integrations** | 1,000+ (Microsoft-heavy) | 8,000+ apps | 400+ native, unlimited via HTTP |
| **Best for** | Microsoft 365 enterprises | Non-technical teams | Developers, regulated industries |
| **AI features** | Copilot AI agents (2026) | Zapier AI (chatbot-based) | AI Agent nodes, LangChain |
| **GDPR/compliance** | Cloud-only (EU region available) | US cloud only | Full self-hosting, any region |

## Pricing Breakdown: Real Numbers That Matter for Enterprise

The pricing model difference is the most important factor at scale. Zapier charges per task: each individual action in a workflow counts separately. A 5-step automation running 10,000 times per month consumes 50,000 Zapier tasks. n8n charges per execution: the same 5-step workflow running 10,000 times consumes 10,000 executions. Power Automate charges per user or per flow, not per execution volume, making it cost-predictable but sometimes wasteful for high-frequency automations.

Real cost at 10,000 monthly executions: n8n Cloud at $20/month; Zapier at $399/month; Power Automate included in M365 Business (if already paying Microsoft) or $15/user/month standalone. Real cost at 100,000 monthly executions: n8n Cloud at $50/month; Zapier at $799/month; self-hosted n8n at approximately $10 to $20 per month in VPS infrastructure only. The annual savings of running n8n instead of Zapier at 10,000 executions: $4,548. At 100,000 executions: $8,988. These are enterprise numbers that make Zapier financially unsustainable at scale. Moving 50,000 monthly tasks from Zapier to self-hosted n8n drops the recurring cost to essentially the VPS fee.

Power Automate enterprise pricing is different. The per-user plan at $15/user/month is attractive for small teams. The per-flow plan at $100/flow/month with a 5-flow minimum targets enterprises with specific high-volume automations. Most M365 Business Premium and E3/E5 customers already have Power Automate included.

## Platform Strengths: What Each Tool Actually Does Best

**Power Automate** is the automation layer for the Microsoft ecosystem. SharePoint, Teams, Outlook, Dynamics 365, Azure: every service integrates natively and deeply, with pre-built templates that non-technical users deploy in minutes. Power Automate Desktop adds RPA capability: recording mouse clicks, keystrokes, and screen interactions to automate legacy systems with no APIs. No other platform in this comparison offers this. For enterprises standardized on M365, Power Automate is the least-friction automation path. The limitation: outside Microsoft's ecosystem, integration quality drops sharply.

**Zapier** is the largest integration catalog in automation: 8,000+ connected apps, consistently updated, with polished no-code templates designed for business users. Marketing teams, sales ops, and customer success teams build and maintain automations without engineering involvement. The tradeoff: each filter step, formatter, and lookup counts as a separate task, so a moderately complex automation consumes 5 to 10 times its apparent volume in task credits. Teams that start with Zapier often hit billing pain within 6 months as they add steps to workflows.

**n8n** is the developer-first automation platform. Nested workflows, conditional branching, parallel execution, custom JavaScript in any node, and sub-flow architecture for modular automation design: n8n handles complexity that requires workarounds in Zapier. The visual builder is capable but not as polished for non-technical users. The clear advantage: self-hosting. Any team needing GDPR-compliant data handling, HIPAA compliance, or data residency in a specific geography must use n8n self-hosted. The AGPLv3 license applies to self-hosted; n8n Cloud is a managed offering.

## AI and Copilot Integration in 2026: Who Is Winning the Agent Race?

All three platforms added AI automation capabilities in 2025 and 2026. The implementations differ significantly.

**Power Automate Copilot** (2026) lets users describe a workflow in natural language and have AI generate the automation structure. Microsoft integrates Azure OpenAI Service, meaning enterprise teams get AI automation within existing Azure compliance frameworks. Power Automate AI Builder handles document processing, sentiment analysis, and form recognition natively. Everything stays within Microsoft's compliance boundary, which matters for regulated industries already using Azure.

**Zapier AI** centers on AI-powered interfaces: Zapier Chatbots creates AI agents that trigger Zaps, Zapier Interfaces builds AI-powered apps without code, and Zapier Tables provides AI-connected databases. The approach is user-friendly but less flexible than n8n for complex LLM orchestration. Zapier connects to OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini APIs as first-class integrations.

**n8n AI nodes** are the most flexible implementation. The LangChain native integration, AI Agent node, memory nodes (buffer, vector store, summary), and support for any OpenAI-compatible API enable complex multi-step AI pipelines. An n8n AI agent workflow can retrieve data from a vector store, run it through Claude for analysis, branch based on the output, and trigger different downstream automations. For teams building genuinely AI-native workflows rather than just calling GPT and formatting output, n8n leads.

## GDPR, Data Sovereignty and Compliance: Why Regulated Industries Choose n8n

The compliance argument for n8n is architectural. GDPR Article 46 requires appropriate safeguards for data transfers to non-EU countries. Zapier's cloud infrastructure runs in US data centers, and routing EU personal data through Zapier workflows creates transfer compliance obligations. Power Automate offers EU data residency through Azure's EU datacenter regions, but it remains a cloud service.

Self-hosted n8n keeps all data within your own infrastructure. Workflow execution logs and the data passing through automations never leave your VPS, private cloud, or on-premises servers. For healthcare organizations running HIPAA workflows, financial services firms under SOC 2 requirements, or government agencies with data sovereignty requirements, self-hosted n8n is the only viable option among these three. Over 15,869 companies actively use Power Automate, but the 51.46% US concentration reflects how few operate in regulated non-US jurisdictions where data residency creates hard constraints.

## Microsoft Ecosystem Advantage: When Power Automate Is the Obvious Choice

Power Automate's tight integration with Microsoft 365 creates genuine advantages that Zapier and n8n cannot match through third-party integrations. When a team works in Teams, stores files in SharePoint, manages customer relationships in Dynamics, and runs workloads on Azure, Power Automate triggers natively from Teams messages, SharePoint item creation, Outlook calendar events, and Dynamics record updates. The depth of these integrations is orders of magnitude better than what Zapier achieves through its Microsoft connectors.

Power Automate Desktop is the other unique capability: screen recording-based RPA that automates Windows desktop applications, web browsers, and legacy systems without APIs. This matters for enterprises running Oracle EBS, SAP on-premises, or other legacy systems that Zapier and n8n cannot touch because there is no API. If 20 percent or more of your automation targets involve legacy systems, Power Automate Desktop is the only tool in this comparison that handles them. The limitation: Power Automate's advantage evaporates outside Microsoft's ecosystem. Automations spanning Salesforce, custom APIs, and cloud-native SaaS require connectors that are not as well-maintained as Microsoft's own.

## Developer Experience vs No-Code: Complexity Handling Compared

**Zapier** is designed for the maximum accessible use case: a non-technical marketer can build a functional Zap in 20 minutes. This is a genuine strength. The tradeoff: complexity requires workarounds. Looping over a list of items, handling API errors with retries, and building modular sub-workflows that reuse common logic all require hacks or upgrades in Zapier.

**n8n** handles complexity natively. Every node type supports JavaScript expressions. Nested workflows are first-class. Error handling is configurable per node. The UI is more complex and the learning curve is steeper for non-technical users. But for developers building automation infrastructure with database lookups, custom business logic, multi-path branching, or complex data transformation, n8n is the clear choice.

**Power Automate** sits between the two: more structured than n8n (less raw flexibility) but more powerful than Zapier for Microsoft-specific scenarios. Enterprise developers familiar with Power FX can express complex logic; non-technical users can use the template library effectively. The governance and audit tooling is better than either Zapier or n8n for enterprises needing workflow versioning, approval chains, and DLP policy enforcement.

## How to Choose: Decision Framework by Company Type

The right choice depends almost entirely on three factors: your existing software stack, your team technical level, and your data compliance requirements. Choose Power Automate if your organization is Microsoft 365-first, you already pay for M365 Business Premium or E3/E5 where Power Automate is included, you need to automate legacy Windows desktop applications via RPA, or IT governance and DLP policy enforcement are requirements. Choose Zapier if your team is primarily non-technical business users, you need 8,000+ app integrations with minimal custom code, your workflow volume is low to medium (under 20,000 tasks per month before pricing becomes painful), and quick deployment with minimal IT involvement is the priority. Choose n8n if you have GDPR, HIPAA, or data residency requirements requiring self-hosting, your workflow volume is medium to high where Zapier's per-task pricing is unsustainable, you are building AI-native automation pipelines with LLMs and complex branching, or your team includes developers comfortable with JavaScript and self-hosted infrastructure.

## FAQ

**Is n8n really that much cheaper than Zapier at enterprise scale?**

Yes. At 10,000 monthly executions, n8n Cloud at $20 costs 95 percent less than Zapier at $399. At 100,000 executions, n8n Cloud at $50 vs Zapier at $799. Self-hosted n8n reduces costs further to infrastructure only at typically $10 to $20 per month on a basic VPS.

**Can Power Automate replace Zapier for non-Microsoft integrations?**

For non-Microsoft SaaS integrations, Power Automate quality is inconsistent. Zapier's connectors for Salesforce, HubSpot, Stripe, and cloud-native tools are better maintained. Power Automate's strength is Microsoft ecosystem depth, not breadth of third-party integrations.

**Which platform best supports AI agent workflows in 2026?**

n8n leads for complex AI agent orchestration via native LangChain integration, multi-model agent nodes, vector store memory, and support for any OpenAI-compatible API. Power Automate Copilot leads for natural language workflow creation within Microsoft's compliance boundary. Zapier AI is best for non-technical users building basic AI-triggered workflows.

**Is n8n suitable for non-technical teams?**

n8n has a steeper learning curve than Zapier. Non-technical users can use n8n's visual builder for simple workflows, but the platform's full power requires comfort with JavaScript and API concepts. Teams with at least one technical member get the most from n8n.

**Does Power Automate comply with GDPR?**

Power Automate offers EU data residency through Azure EU datacenters and Microsoft provides Standard Contractual Clauses for data transfers. However, it remains a cloud service. For organizations requiring all data processing within their own infrastructure, self-hosted n8n is the only option among these three platforms.
