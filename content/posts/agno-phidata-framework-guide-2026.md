Agno is an open-source Python framework for building AI agents that instantiates agents in ~3 microseconds — 5,000x faster than LangGraph — while using ~5KB of memory per agent. Formerly known as Phidata, it was rebranded in January 2025 and now has 39,100+ GitHub stars. You can ship a production-ready agent with memory and tools in under 20 lines of Python.

## What Is Agno? The Phidata Rebrand Explained

Agno is a high-performance, model-agnostic Python framework for building AI agents and multi-agent systems, formerly distributed under the name Phidata until January 2025. The rebrand was deliberate: "Phidata" had become associated with data engineering pipelines, while the team's actual focus had shifted entirely to agentic systems. The new name comes from the ancient Greek word ἁγνὸ (agno), meaning "pure" — reflecting the framework's philosophy of a clean, minimal API that avoids the orchestration bloat common in rival frameworks. Agno is developed by a small core team and backed by a fast-growing open-source community that crossed 39,100 GitHub stars in March 2026, making it one of the fastest-growing AI agent libraries in Python. The framework is structured around three layers: the SDK (the Python library developers use), AgentOS (a managed runtime for production deployment), and a Control Plane UI for monitoring agent sessions and traces. Nothing in Agno's design requires a specific LLM provider — it supports OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Mistral, and local Ollama models out of the box. Unlike LangGraph's graph-based orchestration or CrewAI's role-based crew model, Agno prioritizes raw performance and simplicity, letting developers compose agents without being forced into a particular mental model.

## Why Agno Is Claimed to Be the Fastest Python Agent Framework

Agno achieves agent instantiation in approximately 3 microseconds and maintains an average memory footprint of just ~5KB per agent — benchmarks the team measures against LangGraph, which clocks in at roughly 5,000x slower instantiation and 50x higher memory usage per agent. These numbers are not just marketing: the difference becomes operationally significant at scale. A system running 10,000 concurrent agent sessions in LangGraph might require gigabytes of RAM and suffer cold-start latency in the hundreds of milliseconds; the same system in Agno stays under 50MB and starts in microseconds. Agno achieves this through lean architecture: agents are plain Python objects with no heavy base class inheritance, no global registries, and no framework-level event loops that agents must subscribe to. Tool execution is direct function dispatch — not a pipeline of middleware. The team publishes benchmark results on their website at agno.com, and independent reviews have reproduced comparable numbers. For most developers building a single prototype agent, this speed difference is invisible. But for production systems serving many users simultaneously — customer support bots, autonomous coding assistants, research pipelines processing hundreds of queries — the efficiency gap translates directly to infrastructure cost and response latency. The v2.5.13 release in March 2026 added ReliabilityEval, a built-in evaluation harness for measuring agent accuracy and consistency, further narrowing the gap between "works in demo" and "works in production."

## Core Architecture: Agent, Team, and Workflow

Agno organizes AI systems into three composable abstractions: Agent, Team, and Workflow, forming a layered architecture from single-task workers up to complex orchestrated pipelines. An **Agent** is the fundamental unit — a Python object combining an LLM, a set of tools, optional memory, and an optional knowledge base. A **Team** coordinates multiple agents together, routing tasks between specialists (e.g., a researcher agent, a writer agent, a data analyst agent) either in sequential or parallel execution modes. A **Workflow** is a higher-level orchestration layer that manages the end-to-end lifecycle of a complex multi-step task, including state management, error recovery, and conditional branching between agents. This three-tier structure maps cleanly onto how real production systems are organized: a single customer-service agent, a support team of specialized agents (billing, technical, escalation), and a workflow that routes incoming tickets through the right team members. All three layers share the same tool, memory, and LLM interfaces — there is no separate API to learn for each layer. Workflows are defined as Python classes inheriting from `Workflow`, with `Session` objects handling persistence so long-running tasks can survive process restarts. The architecture avoids the directed-acyclic-graph model used by LangGraph, which requires developers to think in graph nodes and edges even for simple sequential tasks — in Agno, you write normal Python logic and the framework handles the agent coordination underneath.

## Key Features Deep Dive

Agno's feature set is designed around five production requirements that developers consistently identify as the hardest parts of building real AI agent systems: persistent memory across sessions, retrieval-augmented knowledge access, broad tool connectivity, multimodal input handling, and the ability to swap LLM providers without rewriting agent logic. Each capability is a first-class citizen in the framework rather than a plugin — meaning the APIs are stable, well-tested, and covered by the official documentation rather than delegated to third-party community packages. As of v2.5.13 (March 2026), all five features are available in both local development (no AgentOS required) and production deployments via AgentOS. The 100+ pre-built tool integrations, combined with native MCP (Model Context Protocol) support and a `@tool` decorator for custom functions, mean most production agents can be wired up without writing a single custom integration. The features below are the ones that most distinguish Agno from competing frameworks — where Agno does something architecturally different, not just syntactically simpler.

### Memory System (Short-Term and Long-Term)

Agno provides two memory layers that work independently or together. Short-term memory is conversation context held in the agent's session — the raw message history within a single run. Long-term memory is a persistent store (backed by PostgreSQL, SQLite, or a vector database) where agents can store and retrieve facts about users, past decisions, or domain knowledge across sessions. Agents automatically write summaries of completed sessions to long-term memory and query it at the start of new sessions to recover context. This dual-layer design mirrors how humans work: you hold the current conversation in working memory while drawing on long-term experience to inform decisions. Configuring long-term memory requires one extra parameter: `memory=AgentMemory(db=PostgresMemoryDb(...))`. Developers using the managed AgentOS layer get hosted memory with zero configuration.

### Knowledge Base and Agentic RAG

Agno's knowledge base system implements what the team calls "Agentic RAG" — retrieval-augmented generation controlled by the agent itself rather than hard-wired at the framework level. An agent with a `knowledge` parameter can decide when to search the knowledge base, what query to issue, and how to integrate retrieved chunks into its response. The knowledge base supports PDFs, web pages, JSON files, CSV data, and vector embeddings stored in pgvector, Pinecone, or Qdrant. Unlike traditional RAG pipelines where retrieval is a fixed pre-processing step, Agno agents can query the knowledge base multiple times per turn, refine their queries based on intermediate results, and combine knowledge-base retrieval with live web search in a single response. This makes it genuinely useful for complex research tasks where the agent must cross-reference multiple sources.

### 100+ Tool Integrations and MCP Support

Agno ships with over 100 pre-built tool integrations covering web search (DuckDuckGo, Tavily, Exa), data analysis (Pandas, SQL), file operations, email, Slack, GitHub, and major cloud APIs. Adding a tool to an agent is a one-liner: `tools=[DuckDuckGoSearch(), SlackTools()]`. Beyond built-in tools, Agno natively supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing agents to connect to any MCP-compatible server — including Notion wikis, Google Drive, and custom internal tools. Custom tools are plain Python functions decorated with `@tool` or passed as callables; the framework auto-generates the JSON schema for the LLM from the function's type hints and docstring. MCP support means enterprise teams can reuse existing MCP infrastructure across different agent frameworks without vendor lock-in, which is increasingly important as MCP adoption grows across the industry.

### Multimodal Inputs (Text, Image, Audio, Video)

Agno is built multimodal from the ground up — not as a bolt-on feature. Agents can accept and process text, images, audio, and video inputs in the same unified API. An agent processing a video upload uses exactly the same `Agent.run()` call as one processing a text query; the input type is inferred from the message content. This is architecturally different from frameworks that treat multimodal as a special mode requiring separate agent classes or pipelines. In practice, this means you can build a single agent that handles a user uploading either a voice note or a text message, or an agent that analyzes both a chart image and the CSV it was generated from — without branching your code at the framework level.

### Model-Agnostic LLM Support

Every Agno agent takes a `model` parameter that accepts any supported LLM — OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude 3.7, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, Mistral Large, Meta Llama 3, or a locally-running Ollama model. Switching models is a single-line change: `model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-6")` versus `model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o")`. No agent logic changes. This model-agnostic design is critical for cost management in production: you can route high-stakes reasoning tasks to a powerful frontier model while directing simpler extraction tasks to a cheaper local model — using the same agent codebase for both.

## Getting Started: Install and First Agent in 5 Minutes

Getting Agno installed and running a first agent takes less than five minutes on any machine with Python 3.10+. The library is published on PyPI as `agno`, not `phidata` (the old name is deprecated). A working agent requires only an LLM API key — no database, no cloud account, no orchestration server. The quickest path is: install the package, set your API key as an environment variable, define an Agent object with a model and tools, and call `agent.print_response()`. The framework handles session creation, tool registration, LLM API calls, and output formatting automatically. For developers migrating from Phidata, the API changed significantly — the core Agent class is rewritten — but the import path change (`from agno.agent import Agent`) and the new model parameter names cover 90% of migrations; detailed migration notes are in the Agno docs under "Migrating from Phidata."

```bash
pip install agno openai
```

```python
import os
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoSearch

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoSearch()],
    instructions="You are a research assistant. Search for accurate information.",
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent.print_response("What are the latest developments in AI agents in 2026?")
```

This 12-line agent connects GPT-4o to live web search, formats output as markdown, and shows which tool calls it makes. No async setup, no graph definition, no role declarations — just Python.

To use Claude instead of OpenAI:

```python
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-6"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoSearch()],
)
```

## Building a Multi-Agent Workflow: Step-by-Step Example

A multi-agent workflow in Agno combines the Agent and Team abstractions to parallelize or sequence work across specialist agents. The following example builds a research-to-report pipeline where one agent searches the web, another synthesizes the findings, and a coordinator agent writes the final report — a real-world pattern used in automated content pipelines, competitive intelligence tools, and automated due diligence systems. The entire pipeline runs in under 50 lines of Python, with each agent using its own LLM model, tool set, and instructions, while the Team handles routing and result aggregation. In production, this same pattern scales to dozens of specialist agents coordinated by a single orchestrating team object, without any framework-level changes — just adding more agents to the team's `members` list.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.team import Team
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoSearch

researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    role="Search for current information on a topic",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),  # cheaper model for search
    tools=[DuckDuckGoSearch()],
    instructions="Search for the latest information. Return key facts with sources.",
)

writer = Agent(
    name="Writer",
    role="Write clear, structured reports from research findings",
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-6"),  # stronger model for writing
    instructions="Write a structured report from the research. Use headers and bullet points.",
)

research_team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    mode="sequential",
    members=[researcher, writer],
    instructions="First research the topic, then write a final report.",
)

research_team.print_response("Summarize the current state of AI agent frameworks in 2026.")
```

The `mode="sequential"` setting routes the output of each agent as input to the next. Changing to `mode="parallel"` runs all agents simultaneously and merges outputs — useful when agents can work independently on different subtasks.

## Deploying to Production with AgentOS

AgentOS is Agno's managed runtime layer for deploying agents to production without building your own session management, memory persistence, tracing, or monitoring infrastructure. It sits between the Agno SDK and the Control Plane UI, providing hosted services for the operational concerns that make agent deployment hard: multi-turn session state, long-term memory storage, structured trace logging, and API endpoints that external systems can call. Deploying an agent to AgentOS converts it from a local script to a network-accessible service with a REST API, persistent sessions across user reconnections, and a searchable trace log of every tool call and LLM response. The Control Plane UI lets non-technical stakeholders monitor agent activity in real time, inspect individual session transcripts, and set usage limits — all without touching the Python code. For self-hosted deployments, Agno publishes Docker images and a Helm chart for Kubernetes. The v2.5.13 release added ReliabilityEval to the AgentOS layer, enabling automated evaluation runs that compare agent outputs against a golden dataset on every deployment — similar to CI/CD for code, but for agent behavior. Teams running more than a handful of agents in production should evaluate AgentOS against the cost of building equivalent infrastructure in-house; most find the managed layer saves several weeks of engineering work.

## Agno vs LangGraph vs CrewAI vs AutoGen: Which Should You Use?

Choosing between Agno, LangGraph, CrewAI, and AutoGen depends on what problem you are optimizing for. Agno wins on raw performance and simplicity — 3 microsecond instantiation, 5KB memory per agent, and a clean Pythonic API that doesn't force graph or role abstractions. LangGraph wins for complex stateful workflows with conditional branching and cycle detection, where its graph model pays off in expressiveness. CrewAI wins for role-based multi-agent coordination where you want to think in terms of "crews" of agents with explicit roles, backstories, and goals. AutoGen (from Microsoft) wins for conversational multi-agent patterns and integration with Azure OpenAI deployments in enterprise settings. The table below summarizes the practical trade-offs for 2026 production systems:

| Criteria | Agno | LangGraph | CrewAI | AutoGen |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Agent instantiation speed | ~3 µs | ~15,000 µs | ~500 µs | ~200 µs |
| Memory per agent | ~5 KB | ~250 KB | ~25 KB | ~20 KB |
| Learning curve | Low | High | Medium | Medium |
| Multi-agent support | Yes (Team) | Yes (Graph nodes) | Yes (Crew) | Yes (GroupChat) |
| MCP support | Native | Via LangChain | Plugin | Plugin |
| Multimodal | Native | Via add-ons | Limited | Limited |
| Managed runtime | AgentOS | LangSmith | No | Azure AI Foundry |
| Best for | High-throughput, simple API | Complex stateful graphs | Role-based teams | Enterprise/Azure |

If you are starting a new Python AI agent project in 2026 with no strong constraints toward a specific cloud or orchestration model, Agno is the default-best choice for most teams. The performance advantage matters at scale, the API is the least opinionated, and the MCP and multimodal support are first-class rather than bolted on.

## Real-World Use Cases

Agno's performance and flexibility make it particularly well-suited for specific production patterns that other frameworks handle poorly. Customer support automation benefits from the microsecond instantiation: when thousands of users simultaneously send messages, each requiring a fresh agent context, Agno's efficiency prevents the memory and latency overhead that plagues LangGraph-based support systems. Automated research pipelines — where an agent searches multiple sources, synthesizes findings, and writes reports — use the Team and Workflow abstractions to parallelize web searches across multiple researcher agents before passing results to a writer. Financial analysis agents processing earnings transcripts, news feeds, and market data combine Agno's multimodal inputs with custom financial data tools via the `@tool` decorator. Code review agents integrated into CI/CD pipelines use Agno's low memory footprint to run dozens of concurrent review agents on pull requests without exceeding container resource limits. One publicly documented example is a deep research agent that runs a researcher-summarizer-writer pipeline using DuckDuckGo search for retrieval and Claude for synthesis — producing research reports comparable to a junior analyst in under two minutes.

## Limitations and When NOT to Use Agno

Agno is not the right tool for every AI agent use case, and being honest about its limitations is important before committing to it for a production system. The framework is still maturing: the v1 to v2 API was a breaking change, and teams that built heavily on Phidata's old API had to rewrite significant portions of their code after the rebrand. The ecosystem is smaller than LangGraph or LangChain, meaning fewer third-party tutorials, Stack Overflow answers, and community-maintained integrations. For highly complex stateful workflows with many conditional branches, cycle detection, or human-in-the-loop approval gates, LangGraph's explicit graph model is genuinely clearer and better-tooled — the performance trade-off may be worth it. AgentOS is a commercial managed service; teams that need full on-premises deployment with no third-party cloud dependencies need to run Agno's self-hosted Docker setup, which lacks some AgentOS features. Agno also does not yet have native support for long-running background agent processes (daemon agents) that persist independently of a web request — this pattern requires custom infrastructure. Finally, if your team is already deeply invested in LangChain/LangGraph with existing integrations, tools, and team expertise, the migration cost to Agno may not be justified unless performance at scale is a hard requirement.

## Is Agno the Right Framework for Your Python AI Projects in 2026?

Agno has emerged as the strongest default choice for new Python AI agent projects in 2026 where performance, simplicity, and production readiness matter. The combination of 5,000x faster instantiation than LangGraph, a clean three-layer architecture (Agent → Team → Workflow), native MCP and multimodal support, and a managed deployment runtime in AgentOS covers the full stack from prototype to production. Its 39,100+ GitHub stars and active release cadence (v2.5.13 in March 2026) signal a healthy, maintained project rather than an abandoned experiment. The cases where you should look elsewhere are well-defined: LangGraph for complex stateful graphs, CrewAI for role-first team design, AutoGen for Azure-integrated enterprise deployments. For everything else — high-throughput agent APIs, research pipelines, customer support automation, multimodal applications — Agno's performance advantage and developer experience make it the pragmatic choice.

## FAQ

**What is Agno framework and how does it differ from Phidata?**
Agno is the rebranded name for the Phidata Python library, updated in January 2025. The rebrand involved a significant API rewrite and a shift in focus from data engineering tools to pure AI agent infrastructure. The core Agent class was rewritten for performance (3µs instantiation), and the framework was restructured around Agent, Team, and Workflow abstractions. Phidata imports no longer work — code must be migrated to `agno.*` imports.

**How fast is Agno compared to LangGraph?**
Agno instantiates agents in approximately 3 microseconds with a ~5KB memory footprint per agent. LangGraph instantiates agents roughly 5,000x slower with a ~250KB memory footprint. This gap matters in production systems handling thousands of concurrent agent sessions — Agno requires dramatically less RAM and delivers lower cold-start latency.

**Can I use Agno with Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, or local models?**
Yes. Agno is fully model-agnostic. It natively supports OpenAI (GPT-4o, o3), Anthropic Claude (claude-sonnet-4-6, claude-opus-4-7), Google Gemini (2.5 Pro), Mistral, Cohere, and local models via Ollama. Switching models is a single-line change in the `model=` parameter; no agent logic needs to change.

**What is AgentOS in Agno?**
AgentOS is Agno's managed production runtime that provides hosted session management, long-term memory storage, structured trace logging, REST API endpoints, and a Control Plane UI for monitoring agent activity. It converts a local Agno agent script into a production-grade service without requiring developers to build their own infrastructure for persistence, monitoring, or API exposure. A self-hosted Docker option is available for teams with on-premises requirements.

**How do I migrate from Phidata to Agno?**
The primary migration steps are: (1) uninstall `phidata`, install `agno`; (2) update all imports from `phi.*` to `agno.*`; (3) update the `model=` parameter syntax (e.g., `model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o")` instead of the old `llm=OpenAI()`); (4) review the Agent constructor parameters since several were renamed or reorganized. The Agno documentation includes a dedicated migration guide. Most simple single-agent setups migrate in under an hour; complex multi-agent workflows with custom tools may require a day of work.
