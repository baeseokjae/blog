Google Antigravity is an agent-first IDE that lets AI agents operate autonomously across your editor, terminal, and browser simultaneously — not just autocomplete, but fully autonomous multi-step execution. With 6% developer adoption within two months of launch and a deeply divided community, it's either the future of coding or a $20-per-month paperweight depending on your use case.

## What Is Google Antigravity?

Google Antigravity is an agent-first integrated development environment (IDE) built around the idea that AI should autonomously execute work across three surfaces — editor, terminal, and built-in Chromium browser — rather than simply suggesting code inline. Launched in late 2025, Antigravity reached 6% developer adoption within two months, making it the fastest-growing AI dev tool on the market at the time. The core model driving Antigravity is Gemini 3 Pro, which scores 76.2% on SWE-bench Verified — a standardized benchmark for real-world software engineering tasks. Unlike VS Code extensions or copilot-style tools, Antigravity's architecture treats agents as first-class citizens: they plan, execute, debug, and document autonomously, producing artifacts (implementation plans, screenshots, video recordings) as auditable proof of work. This fundamental shift from "AI as assistant" to "AI as autonomous worker" is what makes Antigravity worth evaluating seriously in 2026, even with its current rough edges.

## How Antigravity Works: Three Surfaces, One Agent

Antigravity's agent architecture operates across three integrated surfaces that no other mainstream IDE currently combines: the code editor, the system terminal, and a built-in Chromium browser. An agent assigned a task can write code in the editor, run tests in the terminal, open the browser to check visual output, take a screenshot, and loop back to fix styling — all without any human intervention between steps. This three-surface execution is what distinguishes Antigravity from tools like Cursor or GitHub Copilot, which operate primarily within the editor surface and require the developer to manually run tests or check browser output. The terminal integration means agents can execute build scripts, install dependencies, run migrations, and handle git operations. The browser integration — arguably the most differentiated feature — means frontend developers can give agents a design spec and have them iterate on visual output until it matches, using the browser as a feedback loop rather than a static artifact viewer.

### Editor View vs Manager View

Antigravity offers two distinct working modes that reflect different levels of trust in autonomous execution. **Editor View** looks like a VS Code-style IDE with an AI panel docked to the side — familiar territory for most developers. **Manager View** is the standout mode: it turns Antigravity into a mission control interface where multiple agents run in parallel across different tasks or modules. In Manager View, you assign missions to agents, monitor their progress, review artifacts they produce, and intervene only when needed. The experience is closer to managing a small team than writing code yourself. Some developers find this liberating; others find it creates more management overhead than it eliminates — especially when agents make micro-decisions that require review. The right mode depends on your task: use Editor View for focused implementation work, Manager View for large features requiring parallel exploration.

## The Artifact System: Making Autonomous Agents Auditable

The artifact system is one of Antigravity's most underrated features and addresses a real problem with autonomous AI agents: how do you know what actually happened? Antigravity agents produce structured artifacts as evidence of their work — implementation plans showing the reasoning before code was written, task lists tracking execution steps, screenshots capturing browser state at key moments, and video recordings of multi-step agent sessions. This makes agent behavior reviewable and reversible in a way that most AI tools don't offer. If an agent makes a bad architectural decision, you can trace exactly when it went wrong and what assumptions drove it. For teams adopting agentic development for the first time, this auditability is genuinely valuable — it reduces the "black box" anxiety that keeps developers from trusting agents with meaningful work. The artifact system also integrates with Antigravity's knowledge base, so patterns from successful agent runs can inform future sessions.

## AgentKit 2.0: Multi-Agent Parallel Execution

AgentKit 2.0, released in March 2026, is the engine behind Antigravity's multi-agent capabilities. It ships with 16 specialized agents covering domains like frontend development, backend API design, database optimization, testing, documentation, and security review. Each agent has access to 40+ domain-specific skills — pre-trained instruction sets that encode best practices for specific tasks. AgentKit 2.0 also introduces 11 pre-configured command workflows that chain multiple agents together: for example, a "full-stack feature" command that simultaneously runs a frontend agent, a backend agent, and a test-writing agent, then has a review agent check consistency across all three outputs. This parallel execution model is unique in the current IDE landscape — Cursor, Copilot, and Claude Code all operate as single-agent tools. The practical implication: on large features, Antigravity's parallel execution can compress multi-day work into hours, provided the task can be decomposed into independent subtasks with clear interfaces.

### Custom Skills and Knowledge Base

Beyond the built-in agents, Antigravity supports custom Skills — reusable instruction sets that teach agents your team's specific best practices, naming conventions, or architectural patterns. A team can define a "our-api-design" skill that encodes their REST conventions, error handling patterns, and authentication approach, then apply it to any backend agent session. The self-improving knowledge base compounds this: agents save context, successful code patterns, and discovered project conventions to a persistent knowledge store that gets applied in future sessions. Version 1.20.3 also added support for AGENTS.md files alongside GEMINI.md rules files — similar to how Cursor uses .cursorrules — giving teams a file-based way to encode project-specific context that persists across sessions and team members.

## Multi-Model Support: Gemini, Claude, and GPT-OSS

Antigravity's multi-model architecture is a meaningful differentiator. The full model roster as of April 2026 includes Gemini 3.1 Pro (High and Low reasoning modes), Gemini 3 Flash, Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Opus 4.6, and GPT-OSS 120B. Developers can switch models mid-session, assigning different models to different agents based on task requirements. Gemini 3.1 Pro handles complex architectural reasoning and long-context analysis across entire monorepos using the 1M token context window. Gemini 3 Flash handles fast, high-frequency tasks like test generation or documentation. Claude Opus 4.6 handles nuanced code review and complex refactoring — and accessing Opus through Antigravity's $20/month AI Pro tier is significantly cheaper than API access at scale. GPT-OSS 120B provides an open-weight alternative for teams with data residency concerns. This flexibility prevents vendor lock-in and lets teams optimize cost-vs-capability per task, which matters when agents are running dozens of operations per session.

## Built-In Browser Automation: Frontend's Killer Feature

Antigravity's integrated Chromium browser is the feature that gets the most attention from frontend developers and QA engineers — and for good reason. The browser is not a preview pane; it's a fully interactive automation surface that agents can control programmatically. An agent can open a URL, click elements, fill forms, take screenshots, compare against design mockups, and iterate on CSS until visual output matches. For end-to-end test development, this creates a workflow that competes directly with Playwright and Cypress — except the agent writes the test steps, runs them, and fixes failures automatically. Teams have reported using Antigravity's browser automation to build complete E2E test suites for existing applications by having agents systematically exercise all user flows and generate test code from observed behavior. The caveat: browser agents require careful sandboxing because they can interact with live systems if pointed at production URLs.

## MCP Integration and External Services

Early 2026 brought Model Context Protocol (MCP) support to Antigravity, enabling agents to connect to external services through standardized interfaces. The practical result: agents can query GitHub issues to understand what they're building, read from databases to inform schema decisions, call internal APIs to test integration behavior, and push results back to project management tools. MCP support puts Antigravity on par with Claude Code and Cursor's growing MCP ecosystem, and it's a significant expansion of what autonomous agents can accomplish. An agent working on a bug fix can now read the GitHub issue, pull the relevant database schema, reproduce the error against a real data sample, fix the code, run the tests, and open a PR — without the developer touching any of those systems manually. The depth of integration depends on which MCP servers your team has configured, but the potential for full-workflow automation is real.

## Pricing Breakdown: What You Actually Get

| Tier | Price | What's Included |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Free | $0/month | Preview access, opaque rate limits, Gemini 3 Flash primary |
| AI Pro | $19.99/month | Bundled with Google AI Pro, higher limits, Gemini 3.1 Pro + Claude 4.6 + Opus access |
| AI Ultra | $249.99/month | Highest limits, priority access, enterprise-adjacent features |
| Credits | $25 per 2,500 | Pay-as-you-go for burst usage |

The pricing structure has a fundamental problem: there is no intermediate tier between $20 and $250. For professional developers who need more than the Free tier's opaque limits but can't justify $250/month, the only options are AI Pro with its throttled high-reasoning models or the credit system. The value proposition of AI Pro is strongest for developers who want Claude Opus 4.6 access — the same model costs significantly more through direct API access at meaningful usage levels. AI Ultra makes sense for power users or teams who need parallel agent execution at scale without hitting rate limits.

## The 'Paperweight' Controversy: Rate Limits and Trust

Antigravity launched to significant excitement in late 2025, then lost community goodwill in early 2026 when quota cuts of up to 97% compared to pre-January 2026 levels were reported by The Register. The backlash coined a specific term: the "$20 paperweight" — the experience of paying for AI Pro and finding high-reasoning model access so throttled that meaningful agentic work isn't possible. Several specific issues compound the trust problem: rate limit reset cycles are weekly rather than daily for some users, credit consumption per operation is opaque (what does one credit actually cost in model terms?), and a subscription syncing bug caused AI Pro subscribers to be treated as free-tier users, triggering throttling for paying customers. The community is genuinely divided — some developers report productive daily driver usage at the $20 tier; others report hitting limits within a few hours of starting a large agentic session. Until Google establishes transparent quota documentation and consistent rate limit behavior, plan for rate limits as a real constraint, not an edge case.

## Antigravity vs Cursor vs Copilot vs Claude Code

| Feature | Antigravity | Cursor 3 | GitHub Copilot | Claude Code |
|---------|------------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Multi-agent parallel execution | Yes (AgentKit 2.0) | No | No | No |
| Built-in browser automation | Yes | No | No | No |
| Autonomous terminal execution | Yes | Limited | No | Yes |
| MCP support | Yes | Yes | Partial | Yes |
| SOC 2 compliance | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Artifact/audit trail | Yes | No | No | No |
| Enterprise rating | 4.4/5 | 4.7/5 | 4.3/5 | N/A |
| Multi-model choice | 5 models | Limited | GPT-4 primary | Claude only |
| Price (pro tier) | $20/mo | $20/mo | $19/mo | Usage-based |
| Rate limit transparency | Opaque | Clear | Clear | Usage-based |

Antigravity wins on agentic depth — parallel execution, browser automation, and artifact trails are unique features. Cursor 3 wins on stability, compliance, and predictable behavior. For teams in regulated industries requiring SOC 2 certification, Antigravity is currently not viable. For rapid prototyping, experimentation, and tasks that benefit from parallel agent execution, Antigravity's technical architecture is ahead of the field.

## Security Considerations: Why You Need a Sandbox

Antigravity's autonomous agents pose real security risks that require explicit mitigation. Agents have been documented issuing aggressive shell commands including `chmod -R 777` on entire project directories — permissions changes that would compromise file system security in production-adjacent environments. Because agents operate across editor, terminal, and browser simultaneously, a poorly prompted agent can do significant damage: delete files, modify configurations, push to wrong git branches, or interact with live external services. The security recommendation is unambiguous: run Antigravity in a sandboxed environment — a Docker container, virtual machine, or isolated development environment — where agents cannot reach production systems or credentials. Antigravity does not currently have built-in sandboxing guardrails or permission systems that restrict what agents can execute in the terminal. AGENTS.md and GEMINI.md rules files can constrain agent behavior through instructions, but these are soft constraints, not hard security boundaries.

## Who Should Use Antigravity (And Who Shouldn't)

**Use Antigravity if you:**
- Are prototyping new applications and want maximum parallel exploration
- Build frontend applications where browser automation feedback loops accelerate iteration
- Want Claude Opus 4.6 access at a lower effective cost than direct API
- Work on greenfield projects where agentic security risks are manageable
- Are comfortable managing agents and reviewing artifacts rather than writing every line

**Avoid Antigravity if you:**
- Work in regulated industries requiring SOC 2, HIPAA, or similar compliance
- Need predictable, transparent rate limits for production workflow planning
- Work on large, sensitive codebases where autonomous terminal access is a security concern
- Require stable, production-tested tooling as your daily driver
- Are new to AI-assisted development and prefer learning with more predictable tools

The common recommendation from experienced users is clear: use Antigravity for rapid prototyping and experimentation, keep Cursor or Claude Code as your primary daily driver. This isn't a knock on Antigravity's architecture — it's an acknowledgment that preview software with opaque rate limits shouldn't anchor critical workflows.

## The Bigger Picture: Agent-First as Industry Direction

Even critics of Antigravity's current implementation acknowledge that its core architectural bet is correct. The agent-first IDE paradigm — where AI operates autonomously across multiple surfaces rather than assisting a human operating within a single surface — is where the entire industry is heading. Stanford HAI's 2026 AI Index reports 53% generative AI adoption globally, with 88% adoption in tech organizations specifically. The question isn't whether developers will work with autonomous agents; it's which tools and interfaces will define that workflow. Antigravity's Manager View, multi-agent parallelism, artifact system, and browser automation represent a genuine attempt to answer that question with a production-grade interface. The execution has rough edges, the pricing has trust problems, and enterprise readiness is 12-18 months away — but the paradigm is right. If Google stabilizes the rate limits, adds compliance certifications, and delivers on the promised enterprise features, Antigravity becomes a serious contender for primary IDE status.

## Getting Started with Antigravity

If you want to evaluate Antigravity without committing to a paid tier, the free preview is sufficient for initial exploration:

1. **Install**: Download from the Google Antigravity developer portal; it installs alongside existing IDEs without conflict
2. **Create your first Mission**: Start in Editor View with a small, self-contained project — avoid large codebases for initial testing
3. **Set up AGENTS.md**: Before running any agents, create an AGENTS.md file in your project root with explicit constraints on what agents can and cannot do (e.g., `Never run destructive shell commands without explicit approval`)
4. **Use sandbox**: Run your first sessions in a Docker container or VM, not on your development machine with production credentials accessible
5. **Evaluate Manager View**: Once comfortable with single-agent sessions, try a Manager View session with a feature that can be decomposed into parallel frontend/backend work

**Prompt tips for better results:**
- Be explicit about what agents should NOT do (e.g., "Do not modify files outside the /src directory")
- Specify which model to use for which subtasks to manage credit consumption
- Ask for an implementation plan artifact before execution — reviewing it catches bad assumptions before they become bad code
- Use the Skills system early: define your team's conventions as a custom Skill before the first substantive session

## FAQ

**Is Antigravity IDE free to use in 2026?**
Yes, Antigravity has a free preview tier with no upfront cost, but rate limits are opaque and users report the free tier is insufficient for meaningful multi-agent sessions. The AI Pro tier at $19.99/month provides significantly higher limits but is still subject to throttling of high-reasoning models.

**How does Antigravity compare to Cursor in 2026?**
Antigravity wins on agentic depth — parallel multi-agent execution, built-in browser automation, and artifact trails are features Cursor 3 doesn't offer. Cursor wins on stability, SOC 2 compliance, and transparent rate limits. Most developers use Cursor as primary and Antigravity for prototyping and experimentation.

**What models does Antigravity support in April 2026?**
The current model roster includes Gemini 3.1 Pro (High/Low), Gemini 3 Flash, Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Opus 4.6, and GPT-OSS 120B. Models can be switched mid-session and assigned to specific agents in multi-agent workflows.

**Is Antigravity safe to use with production codebases?**
Not without explicit sandboxing. Antigravity agents can issue aggressive shell commands including destructive file system operations. Run Antigravity in a Docker container or VM isolated from production credentials and systems. The tool does not have built-in hard security boundaries on terminal execution.

**What is the Antigravity 'paperweight' controversy?**
In early 2026, Google cut usage quotas by up to 97% compared to pre-January levels (reported by The Register). Users paying $20/month found high-reasoning model access so throttled that complex agentic tasks were impractical, leading to the "$20 paperweight" characterization. Google has not published transparent quota documentation, and the credit system's cost-per-operation remains opaque.
