title: 'LangSmith vs Langfuse vs Helicone 2026: Best LLM Observability Tool for Production
  AI Apps'
---

If you're shipping LLM-powered apps to production, you need observability — not just logs, but token costs, latency breakdowns, prompt version history, and failure tracing. **LangSmith, Langfuse, and Helicone are the three most-used tools for this in 2026.** After running all three in production, LangSmith wins on depth for LangChain stacks, Langfuse wins on open-source flexibility, and Helicone wins on zero-integration simplicity with OpenAI-compatible APIs.

## What Is LLM Observability and Why Does It Matter in 2026?

LLM observability is the practice of instrumenting AI applications to capture traces, token usage, latency, cost, and quality signals across every model call — giving teams the data to debug, optimize, and govern production AI systems. Unlike traditional application performance monitoring (APM), LLM observability must handle probabilistic outputs, multi-step reasoning chains, and prompt-version drift that can silently degrade quality over time. In 2026, companies running GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.5 in production face average LLM API costs of $3,000–$50,000/month, making cost attribution and token efficiency critical. Gartner's 2025 AI Engineering Survey found that 67% of organizations deploying LLMs in production experienced unexpected cost overruns in their first 90 days — directly tied to lack of observability. Without tools like LangSmith, Langfuse, or Helicone, teams fly blind: no visibility into which prompts fail, which model calls spike costs, or when retrieval quality degrades in RAG pipelines.

The core value of modern LLM observability tools goes beyond logging:
- **Distributed tracing**: visualize multi-step chains, agent loops, and tool calls as connected spans
- **Cost attribution**: break down token spend by feature, user, or prompt version
- **Evaluation pipelines**: run automated quality checks against golden datasets
- **Prompt management**: track versions, run A/B tests, rollback bad prompts

## LangSmith: Deep LangChain Integration with Enterprise Chops

LangSmith is the observability and evaluation platform built by LangChain — the team behind the most widely adopted LLM orchestration framework. It has the deepest native integration with LangChain agents, RAG pipelines, and LangGraph workflows, capturing structured traces with zero instrumentation overhead when you're already using LangChain primitives. As of Q1 2026, LangSmith serves over 80,000 developers and is deployed at companies including Elastic, Morningstar, and Replit. The platform auto-traces every LangChain runnable, stores structured inputs/outputs with metadata, and feeds those traces into evaluation datasets you can run quality checks against. LangSmith's prompt hub lets teams manage prompt versions with a Git-like history and deploy changes without code releases. For enterprises, LangSmith Cloud and self-hosted options exist, with SOC 2 Type II certification and SSO via SAML. The fundamental limitation: if you're not using LangChain, LangSmith's value proposition weakens significantly — instrumentation requires custom wrappers rather than automatic capture.

### LangSmith Pricing

| Plan | Price | Traces/Month | Features |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|
| Developer | Free | 5,000 | Basic tracing, playground |
| Plus | $39/seat/month | 100,000 | Teams, evaluators, datasets |
| Enterprise | Custom | Unlimited | SSO, self-host, SLA |

LangSmith's pricing becomes expensive at scale for large teams — $39/seat adds up quickly across a 20-person engineering team. The free tier's 5,000 traces evaporate fast in active development.

### LangSmith Strengths

- **Auto-instrumentation for LangChain**: zero-code tracing for all LangChain runnables, agents, and LangGraph nodes
- **Evaluation datasets**: build golden datasets from production traces, run automated quality evaluations with LLM-as-judge
- **Prompt hub**: version control for prompts with deployment without code changes
- **LangGraph integration**: native support for multi-agent graphs with per-node visibility
- **Annotation queues**: human-in-the-loop review workflow for labeling traces

### LangSmith Weaknesses

- **LangChain dependency**: adding value proportional to LangChain adoption; non-LangChain stacks need manual SDK instrumentation
- **Cost at scale**: trace storage costs compound quickly for high-volume production apps
- **Self-host complexity**: requires Kubernetes and dedicated infrastructure teams for on-prem deployment

## Langfuse: Open-Source Flexibility for Any LLM Stack

Langfuse is an open-source LLM observability platform that works with any model, any orchestration framework, and any language — making it the tool of choice for teams who need flexibility or data sovereignty. Founded in Berlin in 2023, Langfuse reached 14,000+ GitHub stars and 25,000+ production deployments by early 2026. The platform uses an OpenTelemetry-compatible tracing model, supports SDKs for Python, TypeScript, and Go, and provides official integrations with LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and custom model endpoints. Langfuse's open-source self-hosted version is production-grade with Docker Compose or Helm charts for Kubernetes — critical for teams in healthcare, finance, or government where data cannot leave the organization's infrastructure. The evaluation system lets you define custom scoring functions (semantic similarity, regex checks, LLM-as-judge) that run asynchronously on traces. Langfuse's prompt management, launched in mid-2024, provides versioned prompts with SDKs to fetch the latest approved version at runtime. For teams building RAG pipelines outside LangChain, Langfuse's manual instrumentation is straightforward: create a trace, add spans for retrieval and generation, log scores — all in under 20 lines of code.

### Langfuse Pricing

| Plan | Price | Observations/Month | Features |
|------|-------|-------------------|----------|
| Hobby | Free | 50,000 | Full features, 1 project |
| Pro | $59/month | 1M | Multiple projects, 5 members |
| Team | $499/month | 10M | Unlimited members, priority support |
| Self-hosted | Free (OSS) | Unlimited | Full control, bring your own infra |

Langfuse's self-hosted option is genuinely free and fully featured — no feature gating between cloud and self-hosted versions. This is the primary differentiator for regulated industries.

### Langfuse Strengths

- **Framework-agnostic**: works with any LLM stack through SDKs or OpenTelemetry integration
- **Open source**: MIT-licensed core, self-host with full feature parity
- **Generous free tier**: 50,000 observations/month on cloud covers early production usage
- **Cost-effective at scale**: self-hosted option eliminates per-observation fees
- **Active community**: 14,000+ GitHub stars, bi-weekly releases, Discord with 6,000+ members

### Langfuse Weaknesses

- **Manual instrumentation**: non-LangChain stacks require explicit span creation vs. auto-tracing
- **Evaluation maturity**: evaluation tooling less polished than LangSmith's dataset-centric workflow
- **Analytics depth**: dashboards functional but less opinionated than commercial alternatives

## Helicone: Zero-Friction Observability via Proxy

Helicone takes a fundamentally different architectural approach: rather than SDK instrumentation, it acts as a transparent proxy in front of OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, and other LLM providers. You change one line — the API base URL — and immediately get full observability with no code changes, no SDK imports, and no trace IDs to manage. Founded in San Francisco in 2023, Helicone reached 5,000+ GitHub stars and is used by over 10,000 developers as of 2026. The proxy approach means Helicone captures every request and response automatically, calculates real-time costs based on token usage, and provides streaming-compatible tracing without latency overhead (the proxy adds under 5ms p99). Helicone's gateway also provides request caching (cut costs 20–60% on repetitive prompts), rate limiting, prompt injection detection, and automatic retry logic. For teams building directly on OpenAI or Anthropic APIs without a framework layer, Helicone's one-line integration is genuinely compelling. The limitation is depth: Helicone sees request/response pairs, not internal reasoning steps — you get the inputs and outputs of model calls, but not the intermediate tool calls and retrieval steps that LangSmith and Langfuse trace natively.

### Helicone Pricing

| Plan | Price | Requests/Month | Features |
|------|-------|---------------|----------|
| Free | $0 | 10,000 | Basic dashboard, 1 month retention |
| Pro | $20/month | 100,000 | 3 months retention, caching, teams |
| Growth | $200/month | 2M | 12 months retention, rate limiting |
| Enterprise | Custom | Unlimited | Custom retention, SSO, SLA |

Helicone is the most affordable option for teams with moderate request volumes. The $20/month Pro plan covers most early-stage production apps.

### Helicone Strengths

- **Zero instrumentation**: one URL change for immediate observability
- **Built-in gateway features**: caching, rate limiting, prompt injection detection
- **Streaming support**: native tracing for streamed responses without buffering
- **Cost efficiency**: request caching can directly reduce LLM API bills
- **Lightweight**: no SDK dependency, works with any HTTP client

### Helicone Weaknesses

- **Surface-level tracing**: sees API calls, not internal reasoning chains or sub-steps
- **Less evaluation tooling**: no built-in dataset management or quality scoring
- **Limited prompt management**: no version control or deployment workflows
- **Proxy dependency**: adds a network hop; requires trusting Helicone with API key handling

## Head-to-Head Feature Comparison

Across LangSmith, Langfuse, and Helicone, the three tools diverge most sharply on integration method, open-source availability, and evaluation depth — not on basic observability features, which all three cover adequately. LangSmith requires SDK instrumentation but rewards LangChain users with zero-config auto-tracing that captures every chain step, memory operation, and tool call automatically. Langfuse uses an OpenTelemetry-compatible SDK that works across frameworks and languages, offering the best balance of depth and portability. Helicone's proxy approach is unique: it requires no code changes beyond a URL swap but is limited to API-level visibility. On evaluation, LangSmith leads with dataset-centric workflows and LLM-as-judge scorers; Langfuse has strong custom scoring pipelines; Helicone is minimal on this dimension. For pricing, Helicone wins at small scale, Langfuse self-hosted wins at large scale, and LangSmith's per-seat model works best for focused teams where observability is central to the role. The table below distills the full comparison across 14 decision-relevant dimensions.

| Feature | LangSmith | Langfuse | Helicone |
|---------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Integration method** | SDK (auto for LangChain) | SDK / OpenTelemetry | Proxy (1 line) |
| **Open source** | No | Yes (MIT) | Yes (MIT) |
| **Self-hosted** | Yes (complex) | Yes (easy) | Yes (Docker) |
| **LangChain support** | Native | Integration | Via proxy |
| **LlamaIndex support** | Partial | Native | Via proxy |
| **Eval/datasets** | Excellent | Good | Basic |
| **Prompt management** | Yes | Yes | Limited |
| **Cost tracking** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Request caching** | No | No | Yes |
| **Rate limiting** | No | No | Yes |
| **Free tier** | 5K traces | 50K observations | 10K requests |
| **Starting price** | $39/seat/mo | $59/month | $20/month |
| **Latency overhead** | SDK (minimal) | SDK (minimal) | Proxy (<5ms) |

## Which Tool Should You Choose?

**Choose LangSmith if:** You're all-in on LangChain or LangGraph. The auto-instrumentation, evaluation pipelines, and prompt hub are unmatched for teams using LangChain primitives. If your team already pays for LangChain Plus, LangSmith's integration makes the most sense.

**Choose Langfuse if:** You need framework independence, data sovereignty, or are budget-conscious at scale. Langfuse's self-hosted option with full feature parity is the strongest choice for regulated industries or teams with custom orchestration. The open-source community and frequent releases make it the most future-proof option.

**Choose Helicone if:** You're building directly on OpenAI/Anthropic APIs without a framework and want observability in under 5 minutes. The gateway features (caching, rate limiting) provide real cost savings that can offset the tool's price entirely. Helicone is also the best option for teams that want to monitor existing applications without a refactoring sprint.

## Real-World Integration Examples

Real-world integration of LangSmith, Langfuse, and Helicone spans a wide range of effort — from a single-line URL change to a multi-file instrumentation refactor. In practice, most production teams spend 30 minutes or less getting basic observability running with any of these tools, but the depth of what you capture scales directly with instrumentation effort. Helicone is the fastest path to coverage: change the API base URL and add an auth header, and every subsequent LLM call is automatically tracked with cost, latency, and token breakdown — no SDK, no trace IDs, no span management. Langfuse requires creating traces and spans explicitly but gives you control over exactly what metadata and scores attach to each step. LangSmith with LangChain auto-traces every `Runnable` in the chain with no extra code — but stepping outside LangChain primitives requires manual span creation with the `@traceable` decorator or the `RunTree` API. The three examples below are copy-paste ready for the most common setup in each tool, showing what minimal working instrumentation looks like in a GPT-4o application.

### LangSmith in 30 Seconds (LangChain)

```python
import os
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = "your-langsmith-key"

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a helpful assistant."),
    ("human", "{input}")
])
chain = prompt | llm
result = chain.invoke({"input": "Explain RAG in one paragraph"})
# LangSmith automatically traces this entire chain
```

### Langfuse in 30 Seconds (Framework-Agnostic)

```python
from langfuse import Langfuse
from openai import OpenAI

langfuse = Langfuse()
openai = OpenAI()

trace = langfuse.trace(name="rag-query", user_id="user-123")
span = trace.span(name="retrieval", input={"query": "What is RAG?"})
# ... do retrieval ...
span.end(output={"docs": retrieved_docs})

generation = trace.generation(
    name="llm-call",
    model="gpt-4o",
    input=[{"role": "user", "content": final_prompt}]
)
response = openai.chat.completions.create(...)
generation.end(output=response.choices[0].message.content)
langfuse.flush()
```

### Helicone in 30 Seconds (One Line Change)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your-openai-key",
    base_url="https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
    default_headers={
        "Helicone-Auth": "Bearer your-helicone-key",
        "Helicone-Cache-Enabled": "true",  # optional: enable caching
    }
)

# Everything else stays exactly the same
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain RAG"}]
)
# Helicone automatically captures this request with full cost tracking
```

## Performance and Reliability Considerations

Production LLM observability tools must not become single points of failure. Here's how each handles reliability:

**LangSmith** uses async batching by default — traces are buffered locally and sent in background threads, so API failures don't block your application. The SDK has automatic retry logic and graceful degradation when the LangSmith service is unavailable.

**Langfuse** follows the same async pattern with configurable flush intervals. The self-hosted version gives you complete control over the pipeline — you can run it on your own infrastructure with no dependency on external services.

**Helicone** operates as a proxy, meaning its availability directly impacts your LLM API calls. Helicone maintains 99.9% uptime SLA with failover routing, but the proxy architecture means a Helicone outage blocks API calls — mitigated by their fallback-to-direct option that routes around the proxy on failure.

For teams where observability cannot risk impacting production uptime, Langfuse self-hosted or LangSmith async are the safer architectural choices.

## FAQ

The five most common questions developers ask when choosing between LangSmith, Langfuse, and Helicone center on pricing, compatibility, framework lock-in, and use-case fit. LLM observability is still a fast-moving space — all three tools have shipped significant features in the past 12 months — so it's worth checking each tool's changelog before making a final decision. The short answers: LangSmith has the best eval tooling but a LangChain-centric value proposition; Langfuse is the most portable and open-source-friendly option with a generous free tier; Helicone is the fastest integration for any application already calling OpenAI or Anthropic APIs directly. For teams debating between all three, the practical approach is to prototype with Helicone first (one URL change, no risk), then add Langfuse or LangSmith SDK instrumentation on your most critical workflows as your observability needs mature. Below are direct answers to the questions that come up most in engineering team discussions.

### Is LangSmith free to use?

LangSmith offers a free Developer tier with 5,000 traces per month. For teams needing more, the Plus plan starts at $39 per seat per month. Self-hosting requires an enterprise license, which is more complex than Langfuse's fully open-source self-hosted option.

### Can I use Langfuse without self-hosting?

Yes. Langfuse Cloud starts with a free Hobby tier of 50,000 observations per month with full platform features. The paid Pro plan at $59/month includes 1 million observations and multiple projects. Self-hosting is optional, not required.

### Does Helicone work with Anthropic Claude?

Yes. Helicone supports Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT models, Azure OpenAI, Mistral, Cohere, and any OpenAI-compatible API. You change the base URL to Helicone's Anthropic gateway endpoint and add your Helicone API key to request headers — your application code is otherwise unchanged.

### Which tool is best for RAG pipelines?

For RAG pipelines, Langfuse and LangSmith are the strongest choices because they support nested tracing — you can trace the retrieval step (embedding query, vector search, document ranking) as a separate span from the generation step. This granularity is essential for diagnosing whether quality issues originate in retrieval or generation. Helicone sees the final LLM call but not the retrieval steps.

### Can I use multiple observability tools simultaneously?

Yes, and many teams do. A common pattern is using Helicone as a lightweight gateway for cost tracking and caching, while using Langfuse or LangSmith for deeper tracing on critical workflows. The tools are not mutually exclusive, though instrumentation complexity increases when running both SDKs.
