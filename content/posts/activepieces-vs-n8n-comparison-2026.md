Activepieces and n8n are the two strongest open-source automation platforms in 2026 — both self-hostable, both with visual builders, and both positioned as alternatives to Zapier and Make. The decision between them isn't obvious. n8n has 400+ integrations and a mature ecosystem; Activepieces has 300+ with an MIT license that n8n's AGPLv3 doesn't match. The pricing model difference is where the real tradeoff shows: Activepieces counts tasks per flow execution, n8n charges per workflow execution. This guide breaks down exactly where each platform wins.

## Why Open-Source Automation Is Winning in 2026

The workflow automation market was valued at $26 billion in 2026 and is growing at 9–11% CAGR through 2031. The growth driver is enterprises pulling workloads off SaaS automation platforms — Zapier, Make — and onto self-hosted infrastructure for cost, compliance, and data sovereignty reasons. A 20-person agency running 52 automation flows would pay $73.50/month on Zapier. The same workload on self-hosted Activepieces runs on a $6/month VPS. That's an 85% cost reduction — and it's repeatable across team sizes. n8n made this calculation available starting in 2019; Activepieces made it accessible for non-technical teams starting in 2022 with a more polished no-code interface. In 2026, both platforms are production-grade with enterprise customer lists, and the question is which one fits your specific needs better — not whether self-hosted automation is ready.

## The Core Architectural Difference: MIT vs AGPLv3

The licensing difference between Activepieces and n8n is the most consequential technical choice in this comparison. Activepieces uses MIT license for its Community Edition. n8n uses AGPLv3 for its community version with additional commercial terms for enterprise features. MIT means: use, modify, distribute, and deploy Activepieces in proprietary software and commercial products without restriction. AGPLv3 means: any modifications to n8n that you deploy as a networked service must be released as open source. For most teams running internal automation, this distinction doesn't matter practically. For software companies building automation as part of their own SaaS product or embedding n8n workflows in commercial applications, Activepieces' MIT license eliminates the legal review that n8n's AGPLv3 triggers. For regulated industries (healthcare, fintech, government), both platforms are self-hostable on compliant infrastructure — the license difference becomes relevant only if the team has specific open-source policy requirements.

## Integration Count: 300+ vs 400+

n8n has approximately 400 native integrations; Activepieces has 300+ with 60% contributed by the community. The raw gap is real but less significant than it appears. Both platforms cover the integrations that matter for 90% of automation use cases: Slack, GitHub, Gmail, Google Sheets, Salesforce, HubSpot, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and HTTP/webhook for custom APIs. The gap shows on long-tail integrations: enterprise tools (SAP, ServiceNow, Workday), regional SaaS products, and specialized APIs. Before choosing on integration count alone, list your required integrations and check both platforms' current catalogs. The 100-integration difference rarely determines the winner in practice.

**n8n integration advantages:** Longer integration maturity, more community-built nodes, better support for legacy enterprise software connectors  
**Activepieces integration advantages:** 60% community-contributed means faster addition of new tools, MCP server support for connecting any LLM-compatible tool

## Pricing Model: Per-Flow vs Per-Execution

This is where Activepieces structurally outperforms n8n for most teams. Activepieces counts tasks per **flow execution** (one multi-step flow = one task). n8n counts per **workflow execution** similarly, but the practical difference shows in cloud plan pricing:

| Plan | Activepieces Cloud | n8n Cloud | Zapier (reference) |
|------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Free | 1,000 tasks/month | 200 executions/month | 100 tasks/month |
| Entry paid | $5/month (10,000 tasks) | $20/month (2,500 exec) | $19.99/month (750 tasks) |
| Pro | $29/month (50,000 tasks) | $50/month (10,000 exec) | $49/month (2,000 tasks) |
| Business | $99/month (500,000 tasks) | $120/month (50,000 exec) | $299/month (50,000 tasks) |

The per-flow counting model makes Activepieces 3–5× more generous than Zapier at equivalent price points. A 5-step flow running 1,000 times/month costs Activepieces 1,000 tasks; the same flow on Zapier costs 5,000 tasks. For teams with complex multi-step workflows, this difference is substantial. n8n Cloud's pricing is more execution-based and competitive at higher volumes. For self-hosted deployments, both platforms run unlimited executions with no task metering — the cloud pricing difference is only relevant for teams using managed hosting.

## Self-Hosting: Setup and Requirements

Both platforms deploy via Docker Compose on any VPS. Minimum requirements differ slightly:

**Activepieces self-hosted:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  activepieces:
    image: activepieces/activepieces:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    environment:
      - AP_POSTGRES_DATABASE=activepieces
      - AP_POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
      - AP_POSTGRES_PORT=5432
      - AP_POSTGRES_USERNAME=activepieces
      - AP_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
      - AP_REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
      - AP_JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
      - AP_FRONTEND_URL=http://your-domain.com
  postgres:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=activepieces
      - POSTGRES_USER=activepieces
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
  redis:
    image: redis:latest
```

15-minute deployment time on a $6/month VPS. Handles 5,000–10,000 flow executions per day on 2 vCPU.

**n8n self-hosted:**
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  n8n:
    image: n8nio/n8n
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "5678:5678"
    environment:
      - N8N_HOST=your-domain.com
      - N8N_PROTOCOL=https
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=your_password
      - DB_TYPE=postgresdb
      - DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=postgres
      - DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=n8n
      - DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=n8n
      - DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=your_password
    volumes:
      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
  postgres:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=n8n
      - POSTGRES_USER=n8n
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
```

n8n requires slightly more configuration for production (queue mode for high-volume processing, separate worker processes) but the basic setup is similarly straightforward. Both platforms run on 1–2 vCPU servers at low to moderate load.

## AI Agent Capabilities: MCP, LLM Nodes, and Autonomous Agents

Both platforms added AI capabilities in 2025–2026, but the approaches differ.

**Activepieces AI features:**
- Native MCP (Model Context Protocol) support: expose Activepieces workflows as MCP tools for Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible AI agent
- AI Agent flow type: LLM-driven decision making within workflows using any OpenAI-compatible API
- Built-in AI steps: text generation, classification, data extraction without custom code

**n8n AI features:**
- AI Agent nodes: multi-step LLM reasoning with tool calling within workflows
- LangChain integration: native LangChain node support for complex AI pipelines
- Memory and vector store nodes: persistent agent memory across workflow runs
- MCP client node: call external MCP servers from within n8n workflows

For teams building LLM-powered automation pipelines, n8n's LangChain native integration and more mature AI node library have a meaningful lead in 2026. For teams wanting AI agents to trigger their automation (LLMs calling your workflows), Activepieces' MCP server capability is the cleaner integration — expose any workflow as an MCP tool and let Claude or other agents call it directly.

## Where Activepieces Wins

**Cost at scale:** The per-flow task counting and MIT self-hosting make Activepieces the cheapest option for teams running high-volume multi-step workflows. An 8-step flow running 10,000 times/month would consume 10,000 Activepieces tasks vs 80,000 Zapier tasks. For n8n Cloud at comparable pricing, Activepieces generally offers more executions per dollar. The real comparison point: a 20-person agency running 52 automation flows pays $6/month for self-hosted Activepieces infrastructure versus $73.50/month on Zapier — an 85% reduction that compounds as workflow count grows. At the entry paid tier ($5/month Activepieces vs $20/month n8n Cloud), you get 10,000 vs 2,500 executions per month — a 4× difference that matters for teams scaling automation volume.

**Compliance and data sovereignty:** MIT license with Docker deployment on any VPC or on-premises infrastructure. No license restrictions on commercial embedding. Healthcare, fintech, and government teams building Activepieces into their product stack don't trigger AGPLv3 source-sharing requirements.

**Non-technical teams:** Activepieces' visual builder and more polished UI lower the floor for non-developers. Where n8n often requires understanding the execution model and coding in complex scenarios, Activepieces' no-code interface handles more scenarios visually.

**MCP integration:** Activepieces implements MCP server functionality (expose workflows as AI tools) more cleanly than n8n's current implementation.

## Where n8n Wins

**Integration breadth:** 400 integrations vs 300+. For enterprise software connectors and long-tail SaaS tools, n8n's broader library is the more likely winner.

**AI agent pipelines:** n8n's LangChain native integration, agent nodes, and vector store support make it the stronger choice for complex LLM orchestration embedded in automation workflows.

**Error handling and debugging:** n8n's execution replay, error workflow routing, and retry logic are more mature than Activepieces' current implementation. Production workflows with complex failure scenarios benefit from n8n's better error handling.

**Sub-workflow architecture:** n8n supports calling workflows from within workflows with data passing, enabling modular workflow composition that Activepieces lacks as a built-in feature.

**Community and ecosystem maturity:** n8n has been in production since 2019; Activepieces since 2022. The n8n community has more templates, tutorials, and production-tested patterns.

## Who Should Choose Activepieces

The teams that get the most value from Activepieces share a few characteristics: non-technical builders who need a polished visual interface without JavaScript knowledge, compliance-sensitive organizations where MIT licensing simplifies legal review, and high-volume automation teams where per-flow task counting generates significant savings versus per-step platforms. Choose Activepieces if:
- Your team has non-technical members who will build and manage workflows without developer support
- Your use case involves high-volume multi-step workflows where per-flow counting saves significant cost at cloud pricing
- You're in a regulated industry (healthcare, fintech, government) and need MIT license for commercial embedding or strict data residency requirements
- You want external AI agents (Claude, Cursor) to trigger your automation workflows via MCP server integration
- Cost on cloud plans is a primary constraint and you want the most executions per dollar at entry tier pricing

## Who Should Choose n8n

n8n's strongest advantages are its broader integration library, LangChain-native AI agent support, and more mature error handling. It's the better choice for developer-led automation teams building complex pipelines, and for teams that specifically need enterprise software connectors or sophisticated LLM orchestration within workflows. Choose n8n if:
- You need specific enterprise software connectors (SAP, Workday, ServiceNow) that n8n supports and Activepieces doesn't yet
- You're building LLM-powered agents with complex memory, vector stores, multi-step reasoning, or LangChain-based pipelines that run inside your automation
- You have developers who will write JavaScript code nodes for custom logic and benefit from n8n's mature code integration model
- Production automation reliability is critical and you need n8n's error workflow routing, retry logic, and execution replay capabilities
- You want the larger community ecosystem — more templates, tutorials, and five years of production-tested patterns from n8n's 2019 launch onward

## FAQ

**Is Activepieces completely free for self-hosting?**

Yes. Activepieces Community Edition is MIT-licensed with no task limits on self-hosted deployments. You pay only for the server infrastructure (typically $6–20/month depending on load). There are no task-based fees, no seat fees, and no commercial restrictions on the MIT license.

**Does n8n charge for self-hosted deployments?**

n8n's Community Edition is free to self-host under AGPLv3. The n8n Enterprise plan (which adds SSO, audit logs, and official support) requires a paid license. Most teams use the community edition without needing enterprise features.

**Can Activepieces replace n8n for enterprise workflows?**

For most workflows, yes. Activepieces handles complex multi-step automation, conditional logic, and integrations with major SaaS tools. The gaps are in enterprise software connectors (SAP, Workday), advanced AI agent pipelines, and error handling sophistication. Teams with these specific needs should evaluate n8n's capabilities in those areas directly.

**How does n8n's AGPLv3 license affect commercial use?**

AGPLv3 requires that if you modify n8n and deploy it as a networked service, you must release your modifications as open source. For internal automation tools, this rarely matters. For software companies embedding automation functionality into their own commercial SaaS product, AGPLv3 requires careful legal review. Activepieces' MIT license has no such restriction.

**Which has better AI agent support in 2026?**

n8n leads for building AI agents inside workflows (LangChain integration, memory nodes, complex reasoning pipelines). Activepieces leads for letting external AI agents (Claude, Cursor) trigger your automation workflows via MCP server integration. Both support OpenAI-compatible API calls for basic LLM steps.
