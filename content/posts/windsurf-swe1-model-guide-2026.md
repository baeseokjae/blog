Windsurf SWE-1 is the first AI model family purpose-built for software engineering workflows — not just code completion. It handles multi-step agentic tasks, incomplete work states, and long-running edits across the IDE, terminal, and browser. For developers choosing an AI coding tool in 2026, SWE-1's combination of 40%+ SWE-Bench scores and up to 950 tokens/second throughput makes it a serious alternative to Cursor and GitHub Copilot.

## What Is Windsurf SWE-1? The First Software-Engineering-Native AI Model

Windsurf SWE-1 is a family of AI models trained specifically on software engineering tasks — including full-session agentic workflows, multi-surface tool use, and real production codebases — rather than general language modeling with coding fine-tuning added on top. Unlike GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, or Gemini Pro — which were trained as general-purpose models and then adapted for code — SWE-1 was designed from the ground up to understand the *process* of software engineering, not just the syntax of code.

The distinction matters in practice. General-purpose LLMs excel at explaining code, generating isolated functions, or answering questions about algorithms. But when a developer is mid-refactor with 12 files open, a broken test suite, and an incomplete migration script, those models lose the thread. SWE-1 was trained to understand incomplete work states, reasoning across tool calls (linting output, test results, terminal errors), and maintaining task coherence across multiple IDE actions. Windsurf calls this "flow awareness" — the model tracks what has been done, what remains, and what intermediate artifacts exist.

Launched in May 2025 and later acquired by OpenAI for approximately $3 billion, Windsurf's SWE-1 family now powers the Cascade agentic engine inside the Windsurf IDE. The SWE-1.5 update achieved 40.08% on SWE-Bench Verified — matching Claude Sonnet's accuracy — while delivering 13x faster throughput. SWE-1.6 then improved SWE-Bench Pro scores by more than 10% over SWE-1.5. Windsurf ranked #1 in LogRocket's AI Dev Tool Power Rankings as of February 2026, ahead of Cursor and GitHub Copilot.

## The SWE-1 Model Family Explained: SWE-1, SWE-1-lite, SWE-1-mini, SWE-1.5, and SWE-1.6

The Windsurf SWE-1 family is a tiered lineup of five distinct models, each targeting a different point on the speed-vs-intelligence spectrum that developers navigate throughout a typical coding session. Understanding which model to use — and when — is the single most important decision for getting maximum value from Windsurf's credit system.

Here is how the family breaks down:

| Model | Best For | Speed | Intelligence | Access |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SWE-1-mini | Autocomplete, inline suggestions | Very fast | Basic | Free + Pro |
| SWE-1-lite | Chat, quick edits, Q&A | Fast | Good | Free (unlimited) |
| SWE-1 | Complex refactors, multi-file edits | Moderate | High | Pro credits |
| SWE-1.5 | Frontier agentic tasks | Moderate | Frontier (40.08% SWE-Bench) | Pro credits |
| SWE-1.6 | Hardest engineering problems | Moderate | Best available | Pro/Enterprise |

**SWE-1-mini** is Windsurf's inline autocomplete engine. It fires on every keystroke and needs to return suggestions in under 200ms — intelligence is deliberately capped to keep latency acceptable. Think of it like a smarter, context-aware Copilot autocomplete.

**SWE-1-lite** is the workhorse for everyday chat interactions. Free-tier users get unlimited access to SWE-1-lite, making it the model most Windsurf users interact with most often. It handles code explanation, short refactors, documentation generation, and simple debugging without consuming credits.

**SWE-1** (the flagship original) is where the "software-engineering-native" thesis becomes apparent. It's the model that understands tool calls, can read linting errors and adapt, and maintains task state across 20-30 sequential agentic steps. Use it when the task requires judgment, not just text generation.

**SWE-1.5** represented a step-change in benchmark performance. At 40.08% on SWE-Bench Verified and up to 950 tokens per second throughput, it achieves Claude Sonnet-level accuracy at 13x Claude Sonnet's generation speed and 6x Haiku's speed. This speed advantage is not trivial — it means agentic tasks that took 4 minutes now complete in under 20 seconds.

**SWE-1.6** is the current frontier model, with SWE-Bench Pro scores more than 10% above SWE-1.5. SWE-Bench Pro uses harder, production-quality issues rather than the curated dataset used by the standard benchmark — making this improvement more meaningful for real-world use cases.

## SWE-1 Benchmarks: SWE-Bench Scores, Speed, and Real-World Performance

SWE-Bench is the standard benchmark for evaluating AI models on real GitHub issues — the model receives an open-source repository, a failing test, and an issue description, and must produce a patch that fixes the issue. Windsurf SWE-1.5 scores 40.08% on SWE-Bench Verified, matching Claude Sonnet 4.5's accuracy. SWE-1.6 then improved that score by more than 10% on the harder SWE-Bench Pro variant, which uses production-complexity issues filtered from the curated dataset.

It's important to interpret these numbers correctly. A 40% SWE-Bench score does not mean "the model fixes 40% of your bugs." SWE-Bench issues are self-contained, well-specified GitHub issues in popular open-source libraries. Production codebases have undocumented dependencies, context spread across Slack threads, and domain-specific invariants that no benchmark captures.

What the scores *do* tell you:

- **Relative capability**: SWE-1.5 is roughly at the frontier of what purpose-built coding models can do in 2026. A 10-point gap to the next competitor is substantial.
- **Task complexity ceiling**: Models above 35% on SWE-Bench can handle multi-file edits involving 3-5 source files and 1-3 test files reliably. Models below 25% struggle with anything beyond single-file patches.
- **Regression reliability**: Higher SWE-Bench models are less likely to break unrelated tests when fixing a targeted issue.

**Speed benchmarks** are where SWE-1.5 separates itself most dramatically:

| Model | Tokens/Second |
|---|---|
| SWE-1.5 | ~950 |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | ~158 |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | ~73 |
| GPT-4o | ~90 |

At 950 tokens/second, SWE-1.5 can generate a 500-token function body in about half a second. This changes how agentic workflows feel — instead of watching a progress spinner for 45 seconds, the Cascade agent can attempt, evaluate, and retry in under 10 seconds per cycle.

**Real-world Windsurf metrics** showed measurable improvement after SWE-1 rollout: Cascade Contribution Rate (the percentage of code contributions driven by Cascade's agentic suggestions) and Daily Lines Contributed both increased, indicating developers were accepting more AI-generated output rather than editing it into shape.

## Flow Awareness: How SWE-1 Handles Long-Running and Incomplete Tasks

Flow awareness is Windsurf's term for SWE-1's ability to reason across a developer's full working session — tracking file edits, terminal output, test results, and intermediate tool-call artifacts — and maintain coherent task state even when the work is incomplete or interrupted. It is the architectural feature that most differentiates SWE-1 from general-purpose LLMs applied to coding, and it is the primary reason Windsurf claims SWE-1 is "software-engineering-native" rather than just a coding model.

General-purpose LLMs treat each user message as a fresh prompt. Even with a long context window, they lack a structured representation of "what has been done, what failed, and what artifacts exist." A developer who runs `npm test`, sees 12 failing tests, edits 3 files, runs `npm test` again, and gets 6 failing tests is navigating a stateful process. A standard LLM assistant sees that as a sequence of text. SWE-1 was trained on datasets that represent this as a *workflow* — with states, transitions, and intermediate results.

In practice, flow awareness manifests in several concrete behaviors:

**Incomplete state recovery**: If Cascade is mid-refactor and the developer closes the IDE, flow awareness allows SWE-1 to reconstruct the task state when the session resumes — understanding which files were edited, which tests were passing before the refactor began, and where the work was interrupted.

**Tool-call chaining**: SWE-1 reasons across sequences of tool calls — run linter → read output → identify error location → edit file → run linter again — without losing context of the original goal. General-purpose models often "forget" why they started the tool chain after 3-4 sequential steps.

**Multi-surface coherence**: Windsurf's Cascade engine operates across IDE editor tabs, integrated terminal, and browser preview. SWE-1 can correlate a runtime error in the browser console with a specific line in a TypeScript file and a failing assertion in a test — triangulating across surfaces that are invisible to models with only file-based context.

**Long-task persistence**: Complex agentic tasks (database migrations, API redesigns, dependency upgrades) can require 50-100+ sequential actions. SWE-1 maintains goal coherence across these long chains, while general-purpose models exhibit goal drift after roughly 20-30 steps.

## SWE-1 vs Cursor vs GitHub Copilot vs Claude Code: 2026 Comparison

Choosing between Windsurf SWE-1, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Claude Code in 2026 comes down to four dimensions: model quality, agentic capability, workflow integration, and cost. Windsurf SWE-1 leads on agentic capability and speed; Cursor offers the most flexible model access; Copilot wins on IDE breadth; Claude Code leads on terminal-native autonomous tasks.

Here is a detailed comparison:

| Dimension | Windsurf SWE-1 | Cursor | GitHub Copilot | Claude Code |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Best benchmark | SWE-1.6 (SWE-Bench Pro +10% vs SWE-1.5) | Claude/GPT-4o via API | GPT-4o / Claude | Claude Opus |
| Agentic capability | Highest (Cascade + flow awareness) | High (Composer) | Moderate (Workspace) | Highest (terminal-native) |
| Speed (flagship) | 950 tok/s (SWE-1.5) | Depends on model | Moderate | Moderate |
| Free tier | Unlimited SWE-1-lite + 25 credits | 2,000 completions | Copilot Free (limited) | No free tier |
| Pro price | $15/month | $20/month | $10-19/month | $20/month (Claude Pro) |
| IDE support | Windsurf IDE (VS Code fork) | Cursor IDE | All major IDEs | Terminal + any editor |
| Multi-model access | SWE-1 family + GPT-4o | Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini | GitHub-managed | Claude only |
| Best use case | Agentic refactors, full features | Power users wanting model choice | Teams already on GitHub | Autonomous long-running tasks |

**When Windsurf SWE-1 wins**: Long agentic tasks (feature implementations, migrations, codebase-wide refactors), teams that want a vertically integrated tool without model management overhead, developers who need fast iteration on complex problems.

**When Cursor wins**: Developers who want to bring their own API keys, teams that need to switch between Claude, GPT-4o, and Gemini based on task type, or users who require specific model behavior that Windsurf doesn't expose.

**When Copilot wins**: Teams already deeply embedded in GitHub workflows, organizations with enterprise GitHub licenses, and developers working across VS Code, JetBrains, and vim who need a single tool.

**When Claude Code wins**: Developers who prefer terminal-first workflows, teams running autonomous agents on remote servers, and use cases where the AI needs to operate on codebases without a full IDE session.

## Windsurf SWE-1 Pricing: Free Tier, Pro, and Credit System Explained

Windsurf uses a hybrid pricing model: a free tier with unlimited access to SWE-1-lite and a credit system for higher-tier model access. Free users receive 25 credits per month; Pro users ($15/month) receive 500 credits. Understanding the credit math determines whether the Pro tier delivers real value for your workflow.

The free tier is more generous than it appears at first glance. Unlimited SWE-1-lite means developers can run chat interactions, code explanations, quick edits, and documentation tasks without burning any credits. For developers who primarily use AI as a coding assistant (chat + autocomplete) rather than as an autonomous agent (Cascade runs), the free tier may be sufficient.

Credits are consumed by SWE-1, SWE-1.5, and SWE-1.6 model usage — primarily through Cascade agentic runs. Here is a practical credit math example:

- A moderate Cascade run (10-15 agentic steps, 2-3 file edits): ~1-3 credits
- A complex Cascade run (30-50 steps, full feature implementation): ~5-10 credits
- Daily usage for an active developer doing 2-3 agentic tasks: ~5-15 credits/day
- Monthly usage at that pace: ~150-450 credits/month

At 500 credits/month on Pro ($15), an active developer doing 2-3 Cascade runs per day stays comfortably within Pro. Heavier agentic workflows — running Cascade on large migrations or using SWE-1.6 for complex tasks — can push into the 500-1000 credit range, requiring top-ups or the Enterprise tier.

**Cost comparison**: Windsurf Pro at $15/month is $5 cheaper than Cursor Pro ($20) and competitive with Copilot Pro ($10-19/month). The SWE-1-lite unlimited access effectively means the baseline experience costs nothing after the subscription fee.

**Enterprise pricing** adds team management, SSO, audit logs, and higher credit allocations. Specific enterprise pricing is negotiated per organization but typically runs $30-60/seat/month based on credit volume.

## What the OpenAI Acquisition Means for SWE-1's Roadmap

OpenAI's approximately $3 billion acquisition of Windsurf in 2025 is the most consequential event in the AI coding tool market since Microsoft's GitHub Copilot launch. It directly shapes SWE-1's technical roadmap, competitive positioning, and the long-term strategic calculus for any developer or team choosing Windsurf as their primary coding tool.

The acquisition creates both opportunities and risks that technical decision-makers need to weigh carefully.

**What changes post-acquisition:**

*Model access and roadmap alignment*: OpenAI will likely integrate SWE-1 capabilities with GPT-4o and future o-series reasoning models. The SWE-1 architecture's flow awareness could be merged with OpenAI's Operator-style agentic frameworks, producing a combined product that is more capable than either standalone.

*Pricing pressure on competitors*: With OpenAI's resources behind Windsurf, aggressive free-tier expansion and enterprise deals become viable. This puts pressure on Cursor's independent model and could accelerate GitHub Copilot's own agentic development.

*Independence risk*: Windsurf's competitive advantage was partly built on being independent from the major model providers. Now that OpenAI owns Windsurf, teams that rely on Claude or Gemini models through Windsurf may see those integrations deprioritized in favor of GPT-4o and o-series models.

**What doesn't change immediately:**

SWE-1.5 and SWE-1.6 are shipping and actively supported. The SWE-1 family continues to receive updates. Existing Pro subscribers maintain their current pricing through the transition period. Windsurf's IDE and Cascade engine operate independently of the model acquisition and will continue to evolve.

**Practical advice**: If you are evaluating Windsurf for a team, the 6-12 month post-acquisition period is a good time to pilot rather than commit fully. Watch for changes to multi-model support (particularly Claude and Gemini access), pricing shifts, and whether Cascade's flow awareness gets integrated into OpenAI's native products (which would make Windsurf either stronger or redundant).

## Should You Switch to Windsurf SWE-1? A Developer's Decision Guide

Windsurf SWE-1 is the right choice for developers and teams whose primary pain point is long, agentic coding tasks — not autocomplete or conversational assistance. If you spend significant time on multi-file refactors, feature implementations spanning 5+ files, database migrations, or dependency upgrades where the AI needs to work autonomously for 20-50+ steps, SWE-1's flow awareness and speed advantage are compelling.

Here is a structured decision framework:

**Switch to Windsurf SWE-1 if:**
- You regularly run agentic coding tasks lasting more than 5 minutes
- Speed matters: 950 tokens/second vs 73 tokens/second is a real productivity difference at scale
- You want frontier benchmark performance (40%+ SWE-Bench) at $15/month
- You are currently on Cursor but find model-switching overhead annoying
- You want unlimited free access to a capable chat model (SWE-1-lite) with a low-cost upgrade path

**Stay with your current tool if:**
- You need multi-model flexibility (Cursor is better for this)
- Your workflow is primarily autocomplete and quick suggestions (Copilot is fine)
- You are committed to Claude-only workflows (Claude Code is more integrated)
- You work across non-VS Code editors daily (Copilot has broader IDE support)
- The OpenAI acquisition's independence risk is a concern for your organization

**The honest assessment**: SWE-1.5's 40.08% SWE-Bench score and 950 token/second throughput are real advantages. Flow awareness is genuinely differentiated for agentic tasks. At $15/month Pro with unlimited SWE-1-lite, the free-to-paid upgrade path is reasonable. The main risk is the OpenAI acquisition's impact on long-term independence and multi-model support.

For individual developers: start with the free tier (unlimited SWE-1-lite + 25 credits) to validate the workflow before committing. For teams: pilot with a small group on Pro tier for 30 days, measuring credit consumption and task completion quality against your current tooling.

## FAQ

**What is Windsurf SWE-1's SWE-Bench score in 2026?**

SWE-1.5 scores 40.08% on SWE-Bench Verified, matching Claude Sonnet 4.5's accuracy while delivering 13x faster throughput at 950 tokens per second. SWE-1.6 improved on this by more than 10% on the harder SWE-Bench Pro variant, making it one of the top-performing coding models available in 2026.

**How does SWE-1 differ from SWE-1-lite and SWE-1-mini?**

SWE-1-mini is the fast autocomplete model for inline suggestions. SWE-1-lite is the balanced chat model available for free with unlimited access — it handles code explanation, quick edits, and documentation. SWE-1 (and the newer SWE-1.5/1.6) are the full agentic models for complex, multi-step engineering tasks that consume Pro credits.

**Is Windsurf SWE-1 better than Cursor in 2026?**

For agentic, long-running tasks, Windsurf SWE-1 has a benchmark and speed advantage. Cursor wins for multi-model flexibility (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini in one IDE) and for teams that want to bring their own API keys. LogRocket ranked Windsurf #1 in its February 2026 AI Dev Tool Power Rankings, ahead of Cursor and Copilot.

**What does the OpenAI acquisition mean for Windsurf users?**

OpenAI acquired Windsurf for approximately $3 billion in 2025. Current SWE-1 models and Pro pricing remain active through the transition. The main risk is potential deprioritization of non-OpenAI model integrations (Claude, Gemini). The potential upside is deeper integration with GPT-4o and o-series reasoning models, which could improve SWE-1's frontier capability further.

**How much does Windsurf Pro cost and is it worth it?**

Windsurf Pro costs $15/month and includes 500 credits plus unlimited SWE-1-lite access. For developers doing 2-3 Cascade agentic runs per day, 500 credits is typically sufficient. Compared to Cursor ($20/month) and Claude Code ($20/month for Claude Pro), Windsurf Pro is the most cost-effective option for agentic coding workflows with frontier-level benchmark performance.
