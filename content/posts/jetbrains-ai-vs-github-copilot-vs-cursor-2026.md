For Java and Kotlin developers in 2026, the AI coding assistant choice is no longer "do I use AI?" — it's "which AI is worth paying for inside IntelliJ?" JetBrains AI has a native advantage, but GitHub Copilot and Cursor both landed in JetBrains IDEs in March 2026. Here's what actually matters.

## JetBrains AI vs GitHub Copilot vs Cursor 2026: Quick Comparison Table

JetBrains AI Assistant, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor represent three fundamentally different philosophies for AI-assisted Java development — ecosystem-native integration, market-leading breadth, and agent-first interaction. As of April 2026, JetBrains AI (including Junie) is used by 11% of developers worldwide according to the JetBrains Developer Survey of 10,000+ professionals. GitHub Copilot holds approximately 37% market share in the AI coding tools market, which itself hit $12.8 billion in 2026 — up from $5.1 billion in 2024. Cursor grew 35% in nine months but remains a VS Code fork at heart, making it the outsider of the three when IntelliJ is your home. The right choice depends on whether you prioritize type-safe, compile-safe completions; the largest ecosystem of plugins and CI integration; or the most powerful agentic workflows.

| Feature | JetBrains AI Pro | GitHub Copilot Pro | Cursor Pro |
|---|---|---|---|
| Price | $10/month | $10/month | $20/month |
| Native IntelliJ | Yes (built-in) | Plugin (GA Mar 2026) | ACP integration (Mar 2026) |
| Agent mode | Junie | Copilot Coding Agent | Cursor Agent |
| SWE-bench score | 53.6% (Junie) | 56% | 51.7% |
| Java/Kotlin AST awareness | Deep (native) | Moderate | Limited |
| Compile-safe suggestions | Yes | Partial | Partial |
| Multi-file agent | Junie | Copilot Agent | Cursor Composer |
| Standalone IDE required | No | No | No (via ACP) |

### JetBrains AI Ultimate — The Premium Tier

JetBrains AI Ultimate at $30/month adds unlimited Junie agent runs, priority model access, and team analytics. It's the only tier that makes financial sense over GitHub Copilot only if your entire team already pays for JetBrains IDEs — the bundled value is real, the standalone premium is steep.

## JetBrains AI Assistant & Junie — Native Advantage for Java and Kotlin

JetBrains AI Assistant is the only AI coding tool in 2026 that understands the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of your Java and Kotlin project at the IDE level — not through generic file parsing, but through the same deep indexing IntelliJ IDEA uses for refactoring, type inference, and error detection. This means JetBrains AI's Refactoring Agents won't suggest code that doesn't compile, a failure mode that costs Java teams real debugging time with generic assistants. Junie, launched in January 2026 as JetBrains' answer to Cursor Composer and GitHub Copilot Coding Agent, scores 53.6% on SWE-bench Verified in a single run — competitive with Copilot's 56% — but distinguishes itself by refusing to produce type-unsafe suggestions. Teams using JetBrains AI report 15–30% productivity gains in complex refactoring tasks, and the tool saves an estimated 8 hours/week for senior engineers doing large-scale Java codebase restructuring. The native integration means zero latency for context retrieval: Junie already knows your module graph, dependency tree, and build configuration before you type the first prompt.

### What Makes Junie Different from Generic Agents

Junie is JetBrains' agentic coding layer, distinct from AI Assistant's inline completions. Where AI Assistant handles single-file suggestions, Junie plans and executes multi-step refactoring across your entire IntelliJ project — renaming, extracting interfaces, migrating Spring Boot versions — with build verification at each step. For Java and Kotlin developers, build verification isn't optional; it's the difference between a useful agent and one that breaks your CI pipeline.

### Best Use Cases for JetBrains AI

JetBrains AI is strongest for: Spring Boot refactoring and migration, Kotlin coroutine rewrites, Gradle build script generation, large-scale Java package restructuring, and anything that requires IntelliJ's type system to verify correctness. If your workflow lives in IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, or GoLand — and you need an assistant that respects your type hierarchy — JetBrains AI is the default choice before evaluating alternatives.

## GitHub Copilot in JetBrains IDEs: Agent Mode Goes GA in March 2026

GitHub Copilot's agent mode became generally available for JetBrains IDEs in March 2026, ending the long-standing gap between VS Code users and IntelliJ users in the Copilot ecosystem. This is a significant milestone: GitHub Copilot now holds approximately 37% market share in AI coding tools, and the March 2026 GA release means that Java and Kotlin developers on IntelliJ can access the same Copilot Coding Agent features that VS Code teams have used since late 2025. GitHub Copilot scores 56% on SWE-bench — the highest of the three tools in this comparison — and its semantic search feature lets developers find related code across a repository without specifying file paths, a workflow improvement that matters especially in large enterprise Java codebases with hundreds of modules. The Copilot plugin for JetBrains is free to install and activates with any Copilot Pro ($10/month) or Enterprise subscription, making it the lowest-friction addition to an existing IntelliJ workflow.

### GitHub Copilot's Strengths for Enterprise Java Teams

Copilot's key advantages in the JetBrains context: GitHub Actions integration for CI/CD-aware suggestions, the largest training dataset of any tool (GitHub's entire public repository corpus), multi-repository context for monorepo Java projects, and the Copilot Coding Agent for asynchronous task completion that runs while you work on other things. For teams that use GitHub for issue tracking, PRs, and CI, Copilot's native GitHub integration creates a closed loop — the agent can open PRs with its changes, link commits to issues, and trigger test runs automatically. This is the tool's strongest differentiator over JetBrains AI and Cursor.

### Copilot Limitations in IntelliJ

Copilot in JetBrains doesn't have AST-level awareness of IntelliJ's type system. Suggestions are accurate but don't benefit from IntelliJ's deep static analysis — you'll occasionally see suggestions that compile in isolation but fail against your project's annotations or custom Kotlin extensions. For greenfield projects or teams comfortable with code review gates, this is acceptable. For teams working in heavily annotated Spring Boot codebases with custom validation, JetBrains AI's native type safety becomes more valuable.

## Cursor Enters IntelliJ via ACP Integration — What It Means for Java Devs

Cursor's ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) integration launched in March 2026, making the Cursor agent available inside IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm for the first time — without requiring developers to switch to Cursor's VS Code fork. This is a major shift: previously, Java developers who wanted Cursor's agent-first workflow had to abandon IntelliJ entirely, which most refused to do. With ACP, Cursor's Composer and agent features are accessible as a sidebar in IntelliJ, powered by the same models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro) available in the standalone Cursor IDE. Cursor grew 35% in nine months and has built a strong following among developers who prioritize multi-file agent workflows and model switching flexibility over IDE-native integration. The ACP integration scores Cursor a seat at the table for IntelliJ users, but at $20/month for Cursor Pro — double the price of Copilot Pro or JetBrains AI Pro — the value proposition requires scrutiny.

### Cursor's ACP Integration: Practical Limitations for Java Teams

Cursor via ACP doesn't have access to IntelliJ's project model — it reads files but doesn't understand the AST, module dependencies, or build system state. Cursor Agent will generate Java and Kotlin code that looks correct but may introduce compile errors that JetBrains AI would catch at suggestion time. The ACP integration also lacks the IntelliJ refactoring action triggers that JetBrains AI uses — Cursor can't initiate a "Safe Rename" or "Extract Interface" through IntelliJ's refactoring engine. For exploratory coding, writing new features, or generating boilerplate, Cursor's model-switching flexibility and agent power are genuinely useful. For refactoring legacy Java codebases, the native tools are safer.

### When Cursor Is Worth It in a JetBrains Context

Cursor makes most sense for IntelliJ users who: need frequent model switching (Claude for reasoning, GPT-4o for speed), work across multiple IDE environments including VS Code, value Cursor's Composer for large multi-file feature generation, or are already paying for Cursor for their non-Java work. Paying $20/month for Cursor ACP as your sole IntelliJ AI tool is harder to justify versus $10/month JetBrains AI Pro.

## Pricing Breakdown: Which Tool Gives Java Teams the Best ROI?

Pricing in 2026 for AI coding assistants has settled into two tiers — the $10/month base tier and the $20–30/month premium tier — and Java and Kotlin developers need to evaluate these costs against their actual IntelliJ-specific workflows, not generic benchmarks. JetBrains AI Pro costs $10/month and includes AI Assistant for inline completions and a limited number of Junie agent runs. GitHub Copilot Pro costs $10/month and now includes agent mode in JetBrains IDEs after the March 2026 GA release. Cursor Pro costs $20/month and requires the ACP integration to work inside IntelliJ rather than as a standalone IDE. JetBrains AI Ultimate at $30/month is the highest per-seat cost but bundles unlimited Junie runs with JetBrains IDE subscriptions — for teams already paying $24.90/month per seat for IntelliJ IDEA, the combined JetBrains toolchain cost can be offset by consolidating vendors. The key ROI question for Java teams isn't the absolute price — it's whether the tool's strengths align with where your team spends engineering time.

| Plan | Monthly Cost | Agent Included | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| JetBrains AI Pro | $10 | Limited Junie | IntelliJ-native teams, type-safe completions |
| JetBrains AI Ultimate | $30 | Unlimited Junie | Large JetBrains-only shops |
| GitHub Copilot Pro | $10 | Copilot Agent (GA) | GitHub-integrated teams, enterprise Java |
| GitHub Copilot Enterprise | $39 | Copilot Agent + org context | Enterprise monorepos |
| Cursor Pro | $20 | Cursor Composer + Agent | Multi-IDE, model-switching power users |

### Team Licensing Considerations

At team scale, GitHub Copilot Enterprise at $39/user/month adds organization-level codebase context, policy management, and audit logs — critical for enterprise Java teams in regulated industries. JetBrains AI Ultimate has no equivalent enterprise tier as of April 2026. Cursor Business at $40/user/month adds privacy mode and centralized billing. For teams of 10+ developers, Copilot Enterprise's GitHub-native workflow integration typically wins the ROI calculation unless the team is deeply committed to the JetBrains toolchain.

## Performance Benchmarks: SWE-bench, Refactoring Quality, and Real Productivity Gains

Benchmark performance in 2026 shows GitHub Copilot at 56% on SWE-bench Verified, Junie at 53.6%, and Cursor at 51.7% — a tight cluster that means real-world task characteristics matter more than benchmark positions for most teams. GitHub Copilot's 56% score is the highest here, but SWE-bench tasks skew toward Python and general-purpose software engineering; Java-specific metrics tell a different story. In complex Java refactoring scenarios — extracting interfaces, migrating from Spring Boot 2.x to 3.x, or restructuring Gradle multi-project builds — JetBrains AI's AST-awareness prevents compile-breaking suggestions that SWE-bench doesn't penalize but production CI pipelines do. The JetBrains Developer Survey (January 2026, 10,000+ respondents) found JetBrains AI saves approximately 8 hours/week for engineers doing complex refactoring, and teams report 15–30% productivity gains — metrics that align with the 55% task completion improvement GitHub Copilot reports from its own enterprise customers. Claude Code overtook both GitHub Copilot and Cursor as the most-used AI coding tool among survey respondents by February 2026, though this reflects terminal-based usage rather than IDE integration.

### Real-World Java Performance: What the Benchmarks Don't Show

SWE-bench measures the ability to solve GitHub issues autonomously. For Java and Kotlin teams, the more relevant metrics are: compile error rate on agent-generated code, accuracy on Spring annotation-heavy codebases, speed of multi-module refactoring, and build system integration quality. JetBrains AI wins on compile error rate because it validates against IntelliJ's type model. Copilot wins on multi-repository context and asynchronous agent execution. Cursor wins on model flexibility and Composer's multi-file generation speed. No single tool dominates across all four.

### Productivity Impact by Team Role

- **Senior Java engineers doing large refactors**: JetBrains AI (AST-safe, 8 hours/week saved)
- **Full-stack teams spanning Java and JS/Python**: GitHub Copilot (uniform experience across environments)
- **Greenfield Kotlin development**: Any of the three; Junie's Kotlin support is strongest
- **Teams in GitHub-native CI/CD pipelines**: GitHub Copilot Coding Agent (PR automation, issue linking)
- **Power users who switch models frequently**: Cursor Pro (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini access)

## Which AI Coding Tool Should Java and Kotlin Developers Choose in 2026?

For Java and Kotlin developers choosing an AI coding assistant in 2026, the answer depends on a single axis: how deeply embedded are you in the JetBrains ecosystem versus the broader GitHub/multi-IDE world? JetBrains AI Pro at $10/month is the strongest default for IntelliJ IDEA users who work primarily in Java and Kotlin, need compile-safe suggestions, and want agentic refactoring that respects their project's type system. GitHub Copilot Pro at $10/month is the better choice for teams embedded in GitHub workflows, those working across multiple IDEs and languages, or anyone who values the highest SWE-bench benchmark score and the broadest training corpus. Cursor Pro at $20/month is the right choice for developers who need frequent model switching, already use Cursor for non-Java work, or want Composer's multi-file generation power and are willing to trade type-system awareness for flexibility. The March 2026 releases of Copilot agent mode and Cursor ACP for JetBrains IDEs eliminated the "you must leave IntelliJ" barrier — but they didn't eliminate the native advantage JetBrains AI holds for AST-level Java and Kotlin development.

### The One-Tool Recommendation

If you write Java or Kotlin full-time in IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio, start with JetBrains AI Pro at $10/month. If you hit its limits on agentic tasks, add GitHub Copilot at the same price point rather than upgrading to JetBrains AI Ultimate — you get a higher-scoring agent and GitHub workflow integration for the same cost. Cursor is worth evaluating if model flexibility matters to your workflow, but the $20/month ACP integration is a secondary tool, not a replacement for a native assistant.

## FAQ

Java and Kotlin developers evaluating AI coding tools in 2026 share a consistent set of questions: whether JetBrains AI's native advantage justifies its cost over GitHub Copilot, whether Cursor's March 2026 ACP integration makes it a viable IntelliJ tool, and how Junie compares to the Copilot Coding Agent for autonomous refactoring tasks. The answers depend heavily on team context — a 5-person Kotlin startup and a 200-person enterprise Java shop have different constraints around pricing, compliance, and workflow integration. The five questions below represent the decisions that matter most for developers choosing between JetBrains AI Pro, GitHub Copilot Pro, and Cursor Pro in the JetBrains IDE ecosystem as of April 2026. All three tools have changed significantly in Q1 2026: Junie launched in January, Copilot agent went GA for JetBrains in March, and Cursor ACP brought the Cursor agent into IntelliJ for the first time.

### Is JetBrains AI worth it over GitHub Copilot for Java developers?

Yes, for developers who spend most of their time in IntelliJ IDEA doing Java or Kotlin development. JetBrains AI's AST-level understanding means its suggestions are validated against your project's actual type system — it won't suggest code that doesn't compile in your specific build context. GitHub Copilot has a higher SWE-bench score (56% vs 53.6% for Junie) and better GitHub workflow integration, but lacks IntelliJ's deep static analysis awareness. At the same $10/month price, the choice depends on whether compile safety or benchmark performance matters more to your team.

### Does Cursor work inside IntelliJ IDEA in 2026?

Yes, since March 2026. Cursor's ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) integration allows Cursor's agent and Composer features to run inside IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm without switching to Cursor's standalone VS Code fork. However, the ACP integration doesn't have access to IntelliJ's project model or type system, so Cursor inside IntelliJ generates code without the AST-level validation that JetBrains AI provides natively. At $20/month for Cursor Pro, this is a meaningful limitation for Java teams doing heavy refactoring.

### What is JetBrains Junie and how does it compare to GitHub Copilot's agent?

Junie is JetBrains' agentic coding layer, launched in January 2026 as a direct competitor to GitHub Copilot Coding Agent and Cursor Composer. Junie operates within IntelliJ IDEA and plans multi-step refactoring tasks — extracting interfaces, migrating build systems, restructuring packages — while verifying compilation at each step. Junie scores 53.6% on SWE-bench Verified; GitHub Copilot's agent scores 56%. Copilot's agent has the edge on asynchronous execution and GitHub PR automation; Junie's edge is compile-safe, type-aware execution for Java and Kotlin codebases.

### How much does JetBrains AI cost compared to GitHub Copilot in 2026?

JetBrains AI Pro costs $10/month, matching GitHub Copilot Pro. JetBrains AI Ultimate costs $30/month and adds unlimited Junie agent runs and team analytics. GitHub Copilot Enterprise costs $39/user/month with organization-level context and policy controls. Cursor Pro sits at $20/month. For individual developers, JetBrains AI Pro and Copilot Pro are priced identically — the differentiation is feature set, not cost. For enterprise teams, Copilot Enterprise's GitHub-native features often justify its premium over JetBrains AI's lack of an enterprise tier.

### Which AI coding tool is best for Kotlin development in 2026?

JetBrains AI is the strongest choice for Kotlin-specific development, particularly for Android Studio users and teams using Kotlin coroutines, Kotlin Multiplatform, or heavy use of Kotlin's extension functions and DSLs. JetBrains AI understands Kotlin's type system at the IDE level and can safely refactor coroutine-heavy code where generic assistants introduce runtime errors. GitHub Copilot has broad Kotlin support but generates suggestions without IntelliJ's Kotlin analysis backing. Cursor's Kotlin support via ACP is functional for new code generation but lacks the refactoring depth. For greenfield Kotlin projects with less legacy complexity, all three tools are viable; for production Kotlin codebases, JetBrains AI's native advantage is clearest.
