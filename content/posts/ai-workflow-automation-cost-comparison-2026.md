The right automation platform can cut your workflow spend by 80–90% — or quietly multiply it every time an AI agent reasons through a task. Zapier, Make.com, and n8n each charge differently, and that difference explodes at scale. This guide breaks down the real numbers so you can pick the platform that won't surprise you at invoice time.

## The Billing Model That Changes Everything (Task vs Execution vs Operation)

The most important factor in AI workflow automation cost comparison is understanding that Zapier, Make.com, and n8n count your usage in fundamentally different units — and those units produce wildly different bills for identical workloads. Zapier charges per **task**: every action step in a workflow consumes one billable unit, so a 10-step Zap costs 10 tasks per run. Make.com charges per **operation**, which works similarly to tasks but at a significantly lower price per unit. n8n charges per **execution**: the entire workflow, regardless of how many steps it contains, counts as one execution. For a simple 2-step workflow, the difference is minor. For a 15-step AI pipeline running 10,000 times a month, the difference can be $2,000 versus $200. As AI agents gain traction in 2026 — with each LLM reasoning step generating multiple sub-actions — Zapier's per-task model effectively taxes every thought your AI takes. This billing architecture is the single most important number to understand before choosing a platform.

### Why the Step Count Matters So Much for AI

An AI agent workflow is not a linear 3-step pipeline — it's a dynamic graph. A typical GPT-4o reasoning node might: retrieve context from a vector database (1 task), call a sub-agent (1 task), parse a JSON response (1 task), branch based on output (1 task), then write to a CRM (1 task). That is 5 tasks for what a developer considers one "AI decision." On n8n, it's one execution. On Zapier, you just spent 5 tasks on a single agent reasoning step, and AI agents make dozens of such steps per workflow run.

### The Operation vs Task Distinction

Make.com uses "operations" rather than tasks, but the practical effect is similar to Zapier — each module in a scenario consumes one operation. The critical difference is price: Make's operations are priced at roughly 40–60% of Zapier's task cost at equivalent volume. For a team running 500,000 steps per month, Make costs approximately $299–$399 versus Zapier's $599–$799. n8n's execution model sidesteps this entirely for complex multi-step flows.

## Real Cost Breakdown at Scale — 10,000 Workflow Runs Per Month

The real-world cost gap between these platforms becomes undeniable once you run the actual math on 10,000 workflow executions per month — the typical volume for a mid-size team automating customer support, lead enrichment, or content pipelines. A 10-step workflow at 10,000 runs per month generates 100,000 billable units on Zapier. That volume sits in Zapier's Professional plan ($49/month at 2,000 tasks) to Team plan territory ($69/month at 2,000 tasks), but 100,000 tasks pushes you into custom enterprise pricing that routinely runs $800–$2,000/month. Make.com at 100,000 operations lands around $299/month on the Teams tier. n8n at 10,000 executions costs $60/month on the Pro plan (which includes 10,000 executions). For a 10-step workflow, n8n is 13–33x cheaper than Zapier. The workflow automation market was valued at $26.01B in 2026 — and this pricing gap is precisely why n8n's growth from $40M ARR to $2.5B valuation happened in under four months after their October 2025 Series C.

### Side-by-Side: 10-Step Workflow, 10,000 Runs/Month

| Platform | Billing Unit | Units Consumed | Estimated Monthly Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zapier | Per task | 100,000 tasks | ~$1,200–$2,000 |
| Make.com | Per operation | 100,000 operations | ~$299–$399 |
| n8n Cloud | Per execution | 10,000 executions | ~$60 |
| n8n Self-Hosted | Flat (infra only) | Unlimited | ~$50 (VPS) |

### The Overage Trap

Zapier charges overage at 1.25× the base task cost once you exceed your monthly plan limit. If you budgeted $200/month but your AI agent triggers 3× more than expected during a traffic spike, your bill hits $600+ automatically. Make.com's overage is cheaper per unit. n8n's execution model means a 10-step workflow spiking to 20 steps doesn't change your bill — you still consumed one execution.

## Pricing Tiers Compared: Zapier vs Make vs n8n (2026 Plans)

Comparing pricing tiers directly reveals which platform makes financial sense for different team sizes and workflow complexities. Zapier's Free tier allows 100 tasks/month with only 2-step Zaps — unusable for real AI workflows. The Starter plan ($29.99/month) gives 750 tasks, and Professional ($73.50/month) provides 2,000 tasks. Team pricing ($103.50/month) unlocks 2,000 tasks with collaboration features. Make.com's Free tier offers 1,000 operations/month with a 15-minute minimum trigger interval — borderline useful for testing. The Core plan ($10.59/month) provides 10,000 operations. Teams get 10,000 operations at $29/month. n8n's Cloud Starter is $24/month for 2,500 executions; Pro is $60/month for 10,000 executions; Enterprise pricing is negotiated per seat. For teams running more than 5,000 complex workflow runs per month, n8n Pro is unambiguously the cheapest cloud option among the three.

### Free Tier Reality Check

| Platform | Free Tasks/Executions | Multi-Step AI Flows? | Polling Interval |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zapier | 100 tasks/month | No (2-step only) | 15 minutes |
| Make.com | 1,000 ops/month | Yes | 15 minutes |
| n8n Cloud | 20 executions/month | Yes | 1 minute |
| n8n Self-Hosted | Unlimited | Yes | Real-time |

### When Zapier's Premium is Justified

Zapier's higher cost buys something real: 8,000+ native integrations and a no-code UX that non-technical teams can operate without IT support. For HR, marketing, and ops teams running low-volume, simple automations (< 1,000 tasks/month), Zapier's ease-of-use premium is worth paying. The math only breaks down above ~5,000 complex steps per month.

## AI Agent Costs — Where Zapier's Model Becomes a Liability

Zapier's task-based billing model becomes actively punitive for AI agent workflows, and understanding this dynamic is critical for any team evaluating AI automation platforms in 2026. n8n 2.0, launched in January 2026, ships with native LangChain integration and approximately 70 dedicated AI nodes — including memory nodes, RAG pipeline nodes, and tool-calling agents. Each n8n AI workflow run, no matter how many LLM calls, tool invocations, or memory lookups it triggers, counts as one execution. Zapier's Agents feature (launched as beta in early 2026) follows a different model: the agent's reasoning steps consume tasks. A single agent run that makes 5 tool calls, 2 conditional checks, and 1 output write consumes 8 tasks on Zapier. At 1,000 agent runs per month, that's 8,000 tasks — landing you in Team plan territory or beyond. The same workflow on n8n Cloud Pro costs $60/month total for 10,000 executions. Organizations running AI agents at scale should model their cost on n8n's execution count, not on task counts. n8n is the only platform where AI agent architecture — including persistent memory across executions, vector DB RAG, and direct database connections without API intermediaries — is supported natively in 2026.

### LLM Call Cost Amplification

Each LLM reasoning step in Zapier does not just consume 1 task. The typical pattern for a GPT-4o-based agent step is:

- Fetch context: 1 task
- Call OpenAI (formatter action): 1 task
- Parse JSON output: 1 task
- Route to branch: 1 task
- Execute branch action: 1 task

That's 5 tasks per LLM reasoning step. An agent handling 3 sequential reasoning steps per run × 10,000 runs/month = 150,000 tasks/month. At Zapier's rates, you're looking at custom enterprise pricing north of $2,000/month. On n8n: 10,000 executions at $60/month.

### Make Maia vs n8n AI Nodes vs Zapier Agents

| Feature | n8n AI Nodes | Make Maia | Zapier Agents |
|---|---|---|---|
| Native LangChain | Yes (v2.0, Jan 2026) | No | No |
| Agent memory | Yes (persistent) | Beta | Limited |
| RAG pipeline support | Yes | No | No |
| Cost model for AI | Per execution | Per operation | Per task (expensive) |
| Billing impact of AI steps | None | Linear | Multiplicative |

## Self-Hosting n8n: The Nuclear Cost Option

Self-hosting n8n on your own server is the most aggressive cost reduction available in workflow automation, and it's genuinely viable for technical teams — not just a theoretical option. A $50/month DigitalOcean or Hetzner VPS can run n8n with unlimited executions, unlimited workflows, and no per-task billing. Teams spending $1,500–$3,000/month on Zapier routinely migrate to self-hosted n8n and reduce their automation infrastructure cost by 90%+. n8n reached $40M ARR in July 2025 serving 3,000+ enterprise customers, and a significant portion of that enterprise growth is from teams self-hosting rather than paying cloud rates. The self-hosted model also addresses data sovereignty: regulated industries in healthcare (HIPAA), finance (SOC 2), and legal cannot pipe sensitive data through Zapier's or Make's multi-tenant cloud infrastructure without complex compliance review. Self-hosted n8n keeps all workflow data on your own infrastructure with no vendor data retention. n8n execution-based billing can reduce automation costs by 80–90% versus Zapier for complex high-volume workflows — and self-hosting pushes that reduction to 95%+.

### Self-Hosted Infrastructure Options

| Deployment | Monthly Cost | Execution Limit | Technical Complexity |
|---|---|---|---|
| DigitalOcean Droplet (2vCPU/4GB) | ~$24 | ~50,000–100,000/mo | Medium |
| Hetzner CX22 (2vCPU/4GB) | ~$8 | ~50,000–100,000/mo | Medium |
| AWS EC2 t3.medium | ~$35 | ~50,000–100,000/mo | Medium-High |
| Docker on existing server | ~$0 | Depends on server | Medium |
| n8n Cloud Pro | $60 | 10,000/mo | None |

### The Migration Cost Reality

Self-hosting n8n isn't free in human time. You need: server provisioning, Docker/Kubernetes setup, SSL certificate management, backup strategy, and at least one engineer who owns the instance. Budget 8–16 hours for initial setup and 2–4 hours/month for maintenance. For a team spending $2,000/month on Zapier, even $1,000/month in engineering time leaves them ahead. For a team spending $300/month on Zapier, self-hosting may not pencil out.

## Hidden Costs Beyond Subscription Pricing

The sticker price of each platform's monthly plan is rarely the full cost of ownership, and ignoring hidden costs leads to budget surprises that undermine the ROI case for automation. Zapier's most significant hidden cost is **integration depth**: many Zapier integrations are read-only or support only a subset of an API's capabilities, requiring workarounds that add steps — and tasks. n8n's hidden cost is **engineering time**: every complex workflow requires a developer to build and maintain it; non-technical users cannot self-serve. Make.com's hidden cost is **scenario complexity ceiling**: highly complex conditional logic becomes difficult to maintain visually and may require modularization that increases operation counts. Beyond these platform-specific costs, all three platforms share: API rate limit overhead (when you hit third-party API limits, you're wasting paid executions on failed runs), testing costs (each test run consumes your quota), and data transformation complexity (external tools like code nodes or webhooks add operational overhead). Organizations implementing workflow automation see a 59% cost reduction on average, but that figure assumes optimized implementation — poorly designed workflows on any platform can erase the savings.

### Total Cost of Ownership Comparison

| Cost Category | Zapier | Make.com | n8n Cloud | n8n Self-Hosted |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Subscription | $$$$ | $$ | $ | $0 |
| Engineering time | Low | Medium | High | Very High |
| Integration breadth | Excellent | Good | Good | Good |
| Overage risk | Very High | Medium | Low | None |
| Compliance setup | External required | External required | External required | Included |
| Vendor lock-in | High | Medium | Low | None |

### The Zapier Vendor Lock-In Tax

Zapier's proprietary Zap format has no export standard. If you decide to migrate to n8n or Make after building 200 Zaps, you're rewriting every workflow manually. n8n uses JSON-based workflow definitions that can be version-controlled in Git and exported. Make.com allows blueprint exports. Factor migration costs into your multi-year TCO if you're starting fresh in 2026.

## Who Should Use Each Platform (Cost-Optimized Decision Guide)

The right platform depends on your technical capacity, workflow complexity, and volume trajectory — and making the wrong choice in 2026 means either overpaying for simplicity or under-investing in infrastructure that breaks under scale. Zapier is the correct choice when your team has no engineers, runs fewer than 1,000 workflow executions per month, needs a specific integration that only Zapier supports, and values zero infrastructure management above all else. Make.com is the correct choice when you need visual conditional logic that non-engineers can modify, your volume is medium (10,000–100,000 operations/month), and you want Zapier-like ease at a significantly lower price. n8n Cloud is the correct choice when you're building AI agent workflows, have a developer on staff, run high volumes (10,000+ complex executions/month), and need LangChain/RAG integration out of the box. Self-hosted n8n is the correct choice when you handle regulated data, spend more than $500/month on Zapier or Make today, have a DevOps-capable team, and expect your automation volume to grow significantly. Marketers using AI automation save 12.5 hours weekly (approximately 26 working days annually) — the platform choice determines whether those savings are absorbed by unnecessary subscription costs.

### The Decision Matrix

| Situation | Recommended Platform |
|---|---|
| Non-technical team, simple flows, < 1,000 runs/mo | Zapier Starter |
| Marketing/ops team, medium volume, budget-conscious | Make.com Core/Teams |
| Developer team, AI agents, > 5,000 runs/mo | n8n Cloud Pro |
| Regulated industry (healthcare/finance/legal) | n8n Self-Hosted |
| Spending > $500/mo on Zapier today | Evaluate n8n migration |
| Need 8,000+ integrations, no dev resources | Zapier (accept premium) |
| Hybrid: AI core + long-tail integrations | n8n core + Zapier satellites |

### The Hybrid Architecture Pattern

The most cost-efficient enterprise architecture in 2026 is **n8n as the AI and data orchestration core, Zapier for long-tail niche integrations**. Run your high-volume AI agent workflows, data pipelines, and CRM operations in n8n where execution billing keeps costs predictable. Use Zapier only for the 5–10 obscure SaaS tools that n8n doesn't support natively and that run infrequently enough that per-task billing doesn't hurt. This hybrid approach is how engineering-forward teams get both breadth (Zapier's 8,000+ integrations) and cost efficiency (n8n's execution model) without compromise.

## FAQ

**Q: Is n8n actually cheaper than Zapier for all use cases?**
Not for all cases. If your workflows are 2–3 steps and run fewer than 500 times per month, Zapier's ease of use may justify its cost premium. n8n becomes dramatically cheaper at high volumes and for complex multi-step or AI workflows. The crossover point is roughly 2,000+ runs/month on workflows with 5+ steps.

**Q: Can I migrate existing Zapier workflows to n8n?**
Yes, but not automatically. n8n has no official Zapier importer. You'll need to rebuild workflows manually in n8n's visual editor. For teams with 50+ Zaps, budget 2–4 hours per complex workflow for migration. n8n's JSON export format allows you to version-control workflows in Git post-migration, which Zapier doesn't support.

**Q: Does Make.com support AI agents natively in 2026?**
Make.com's AI builder "Maia" was still in beta in early 2026. It supports OpenAI and Anthropic integrations through HTTP modules, but does not have native LangChain nodes or persistent agent memory. For serious AI agent workflows, n8n's native AI nodes are meaningfully more capable than Make's current offering.

**Q: What is the cost of running a GPT-4o agent on each platform?**
The LLM API cost (what you pay OpenAI) is identical across all three platforms. The platform cost difference comes from how many "tasks" or "executions" the agent reasoning consumes. On Zapier, a 5-step agent reasoning chain = 5 tasks. On n8n, the entire agent run regardless of reasoning steps = 1 execution. At 10,000 agent runs/month with 5 reasoning steps each, Zapier charges for 50,000 tasks vs n8n charging for 10,000 executions — a 5x difference before considering price per unit.

**Q: How reliable is self-hosted n8n for production workflows?**
Very reliable when properly deployed, but you own the infrastructure. Use Docker Compose or Kubernetes, set up PostgreSQL (not the default SQLite), implement automated backups, and configure health monitoring. n8n has a 99.9%+ uptime track record on well-maintained instances. The risk is not reliability but operational burden — someone on your team needs to manage updates, security patches, and scaling.
