Gumloop raised $50M in a Series B led by Benchmark in March 2026 — a strong bet on a platform that started as a Y Combinator W24 startup with a single differentiating claim: automation built for AI workflows from the ground up, not retrofitted from legacy trigger-action systems. With $70M in total funding and a 4.8/5 rating on G2, Gumloop has traction. But the credit-based pricing model creates real cost surprises, and 125 integrations against Zapier's 6,000+ is a genuine gap. Here's the honest breakdown after putting it through its paces.

## What Is Gumloop? The AI-Native Automation Platform Explained

Gumloop is a no-code workflow automation platform designed specifically for AI-heavy automation — not as an afterthought feature, but as the core architectural premise. Founded through Y Combinator Winter 2024, Gumloop positions every automation as a flow of nodes on a visual canvas, where each node can be a data source, an AI model call, a transformation, or an action. Unlike Zapier and Make, which started as trigger-action tools and bolted LLM nodes on later, Gumloop treats multi-model AI orchestration as a first-class primitive. You connect GPT-5, Claude 4 Opus, and Gemini 2.5 Pro in the same workflow, add conditional logic, and route outputs based on what the models return. The practical result: workflows that perform web scraping, AI enrichment, email generation, and CRM updates in a single visual flow that would require 20+ separate Zaps and significant workarounds on Zapier. The platform particularly targets growth and marketing teams — lead enrichment pipelines, cold email personalization at scale, and content automation are the canonical use cases. Gumloop's own framing is "turn every employee into an AI agent builder," which explains the $50M bet: the total addressable market for business users who want AI automation without engineering involvement is enormous.

## Gumloop Key Features: What You Can Build

Gumloop's node-based canvas is the central UI paradigm. Nodes snap to a grid, auto-align, and can be collapsed when the canvas gets dense — practical ergonomics that larger canvas workflows require. The feature set that matters:

**Multi-model AI nodes** are Gumloop's clearest advantage. Native nodes for GPT-5, Claude 4 Opus, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro ship within days of each new model release. You can run the same prompt across multiple models in parallel branches and route downstream based on which output passes a quality check — something that requires custom code in n8n and isn't possible at all in basic Zapier flows.

**Subflows** let you build reusable workflow components. A lead enrichment subflow that takes a company name, runs web research, and outputs a structured profile can be called from multiple parent workflows. This is the equivalent of function extraction in code — it eliminates the maintenance nightmare of copy-paste automation.

**Gummies** is Gumloop's built-in AI assistant for workflow troubleshooting. When a node fails or produces unexpected output, Gummies diagnoses the problem in natural language and suggests fixes. In practice, this halves the debugging time for non-technical users who can't read API error messages.

**MCP node support** bridges the integration gap. With 125 native connectors versus Zapier's 6,000+, Gumloop would be severely limited without a way to reach non-native tools. MCP nodes let you connect any MCP-compatible server, extending reach without waiting for official connector development.

**Concurrent runs** scale parallel execution: the Pro plan supports 5 concurrent workflow runs, Enterprise goes higher. For batch processing scenarios — enriching 10,000 leads overnight, processing daily file imports — concurrency determines throughput.

## Gumloop Pricing: Credits, Plans, and Real Costs

Gumloop's pricing is credit-based, which is both flexible and opaque. Understanding the credit consumption model before committing is essential.

| Plan | Price | Credits/Month | Seats | Concurrent Runs |
|------|-------|---------------|-------|-----------------|
| Free | $0 | 5,000 | 1 | 2 |
| Pro | $37/month | 20,000+ | Unlimited | 5 |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom | Custom | Custom |

The credit cost per operation varies significantly. Standard operations like HTTP requests and data transformations consume 1-5 credits. AI model calls consume 10-100+ credits depending on model and token length. The most expensive operations: lead enrichment tasks that perform multiple sub-searches can cost 60 credits per record. At Pro plan rates (20,000 credits for $37), enriching 333 contacts exhausts the monthly credit budget. Teams running high-volume lead enrichment pipelines need to do the math carefully before assuming Pro pricing is sufficient.

A 14-day free trial on paid plans provides enough runway to test real workflows before committing. Gumloop offers credit add-ons at the Enterprise tier for teams that consistently exceed plan limits. The practical approach: start on the Free plan, build your core workflows, measure actual credit consumption, then size the paid plan accordingly rather than guessing.

For comparison: n8n Cloud starts at $20/month with execution-based pricing, Zapier's entry paid tier is $19.99/month for 750 tasks. Neither competes directly with Gumloop's credit model, which front-loads AI capability at the cost of pricing predictability.

## Gumloop Pros and Cons: Honest Assessment

**Where Gumloop genuinely wins:**

Multi-model flexibility is the clearest advantage over any legacy automation platform. Accessing GPT-5, Claude 4 Opus, and Gemini 2.5 Pro in the same workflow — with immediate updates when new models drop — gives teams capabilities that would require custom API integrations elsewhere. The visual canvas is polished enough for non-technical users to build complex flows without developer involvement. Subflows solve the reusability problem that makes large Zapier workflows a maintenance burden. The $50M raise and YC pedigree indicate the platform isn't going anywhere, which matters for teams building critical automation infrastructure.

**Where Gumloop has real gaps:**

125 integrations versus Zapier's 6,000+ is not a minor gap — it's a fundamental limitation. Teams using niche SaaS tools outside Gumloop's connector library hit dead ends that MCP nodes only partially solve. The credit pricing model creates unpredictable costs for workflows with variable AI usage. Unlike n8n, Gumloop offers no self-hosting option, which eliminates it for any team with GDPR data residency requirements or air-gapped environments. The initial learning curve is real — the visual canvas rewards experimentation, but the first few hours can be overwhelming when every node has configuration options that aren't well-documented.

## Gumloop vs Competitors: Zapier, Make, n8n, Relevance AI

**Gumloop vs Zapier:** Zapier's 6,000+ integrations make it irreplaceable for teams with diverse SaaS stacks. Gumloop's AI capabilities are significantly stronger for multi-model workflows. The correct decision: use Zapier for broad integration coverage, Gumloop when the workflow centers on AI model orchestration. Many teams run both — Zapier as the integration layer, Gumloop for AI-heavy processing pipelines.

**Gumloop vs Make:** Make (formerly Integromat) offers better pricing transparency with execution-based costs, 1,000+ integrations, and stronger data transformation capabilities. Make lacks Gumloop's multi-model AI support and is less intuitive for AI-native workflows. For teams that primarily need data routing and transformation without heavy LLM use, Make is cheaper and more predictable.

**Gumloop vs n8n:** n8n's self-hosted option and developer-first design serve different needs than Gumloop's no-code canvas. n8n handles more complex programming logic, error handling, and custom JavaScript. Gumloop handles multi-model AI orchestration more elegantly for non-technical users. Teams with developers and compliance requirements go n8n; teams where business users need to build their own AI workflows go Gumloop.

**Gumloop vs Relevance AI:** Relevance AI is Gumloop's most direct competitor in the AI-native automation space, with similar multi-agent orchestration focus. Relevance AI's table-native data model makes it stronger for structured data workflows. Gumloop's canvas interface is more intuitive for complex branching logic. Both are Y Combinator companies building in the same space.

## Best Use Cases for Gumloop in 2026

Gumloop's strengths map to specific workflow types where the platform earns its cost:

**Lead enrichment at scale:** Combine web scraping nodes, AI research steps, and CRM write-backs in a single flow. Input a company name or domain; output a structured profile with decision-maker contacts, recent news, and firmographic data. The multi-model capability lets you use cheaper models for data extraction and more capable models for synthesis.

**Cold email personalization:** Run prospect lists through AI nodes that generate contextually personalized opening lines based on recent company news, job postings, or social activity. Standard Zapier flows produce generic personalization; Gumloop flows produce genuinely relevant outreach copy.

**Content automation pipelines:** Pull topics from a spreadsheet, run through research subflows, draft content with Claude or GPT, quality-check with a separate model, and push to a CMS or email platform. The subflow architecture means maintaining one research workflow that feeds multiple content types.

**AI agent customer support triage:** Route incoming support requests through classification agents, extract structured data from free-text, enrich with CRM context, and create or update tickets with AI-generated summaries. Non-technical support ops managers can modify the routing logic without engineering support.

## Who Should Use Gumloop (And Who Shouldn't)

**Use Gumloop if:** Your team is primarily non-technical, your core use cases involve AI model calls in workflows (not just triggering them), you need multi-model flexibility with access to the latest frontier models immediately after release, and your integration requirements fall within the 125-connector library. Growth and marketing teams building AI-powered outreach, research, and content automation get the most value per dollar.

**Skip Gumloop if:** You need more than 125 integrations with specialized SaaS tools, your team has GDPR data residency requirements that require self-hosting, you need predictable costs and can't absorb variable credit consumption, or you have developer resources who can build more sophisticated pipelines in n8n with greater control.

**The honest middle ground:** Gumloop is genuinely powerful for its target use cases and genuinely limited outside them. The integration gap is real; the pricing model requires careful monitoring. Teams that go in knowing these constraints and scope their use cases accordingly get significant productivity gains. Teams that expect Gumloop to replace Zapier entirely for complex multi-tool workflows will hit the connector ceiling quickly.

## Final Verdict: Is Gumloop Worth It in 2026?

Yes — for the right team. The $50M Series B, YC backing, and immediate frontier model support indicate Gumloop is a serious long-term investment in the no-code AI automation category. The platform delivers on its AI-native promise for growth and marketing automation use cases. The credit pricing model, limited integrations, and cloud-only architecture are real constraints that eliminate Gumloop as an option for certain teams.

The Free plan is a no-risk evaluation path: build two or three representative workflows, measure actual credit consumption, and verify your required integrations are supported before spending anything. At $37/month for Pro, Gumloop is affordable enough that teams which find it fits their use cases will recover the cost quickly in automation time savings.

The $70M total raised with Benchmark's backing suggests Gumloop has runway to expand the integration library and potentially address the self-hosting gap over time. For teams building AI-first automation today, it's worth putting on the evaluation list alongside n8n and Zapier — the workflow type determines which wins.

## FAQ

**What is Gumloop and how does it work?**

Gumloop is a no-code AI-native workflow automation platform founded as a Y Combinator W24 startup, now with $70M in funding after a $50M Series B in March 2026. It uses a visual node-based canvas where users connect data sources, AI model nodes (GPT-5, Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro), transformations, and actions into automated workflows. Unlike Zapier, which adds AI as an extra feature, Gumloop was built from the ground up for AI-heavy automation where multi-model orchestration is the primary use case.

**How much does Gumloop cost?**

Gumloop offers a Free plan with 5,000 credits/month and 1 seat. The Pro plan costs $37/month and includes 20,000+ credits and unlimited seats. Enterprise pricing is custom. Credits are consumed per operation: basic data operations use 1-5 credits, AI model calls use 10-100+ credits depending on model and token count. Heavy AI operations like lead enrichment can cost 60 credits per record, so teams should test credit consumption before committing to a plan size.

**What are Gumloop's main competitors?**

Gumloop's main competitors are Zapier (6,000+ integrations, better for broad SaaS connectivity), Make/Integromat (better pricing transparency, 1,000+ integrations), n8n (self-hosted option, developer-first, better for complex logic), and Relevance AI (most direct AI-native competitor with table-native data model). Gumloop wins on multi-model AI flexibility and non-technical usability for AI-heavy workflows.

**Does Gumloop support self-hosting?**

No. Gumloop is cloud-only. Teams with GDPR data residency requirements, HIPAA compliance needs, or air-gapped environments must use alternatives like n8n, which supports self-hosting under AGPLv3. Gumloop does hold SOC 2 and GDPR compliance certifications as a cloud service, but all workflow data processes through Gumloop's cloud infrastructure.

**How many integrations does Gumloop have?**

Gumloop has 125+ native integrations, compared to Zapier's 6,000+. This is a significant gap for teams using diverse SaaS tool stacks. Gumloop addresses this partially through MCP node support, which allows connecting any MCP-compatible server. Teams that primarily use major platforms (Google Workspace, Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, Notion, Airtable) will find the integration library sufficient; teams using niche or regional SaaS tools should verify connector availability before adopting.
