Greptile is an AI code review tool that indexes your entire repository — not just the diff — to catch bugs, architectural regressions, and dependency breaks that other tools miss entirely. In independent benchmarks across 50 real-world bugs from Sentry, Cal.com, Grafana, Keycloak, and Discourse, Greptile achieved an 82% overall bug catch rate and a 100% high-severity detection rate, leading every major AI code review competitor. It costs $30/developer/month with 50 reviews included and no free tier.

## What Is Greptile?

Greptile is a Y Combinator-backed AI code review platform that indexes your entire codebase — not just the changed lines in a pull request — to catch bugs, security issues, and architectural regressions that diff-only tools structurally cannot detect. Unlike tools that read only the files touched in a PR, Greptile builds a full code graph of your repository and uses multi-hop investigation to trace how a change in one file cascades through dependencies, shared utilities, and downstream consumers. The company raised a $25M Series A led by Benchmark Capital in September 2025 at a $180M valuation, following an initial $4.1M seed from Y Combinator and Initialized Capital. Customers include Brex, Substack, PostHog, Bilt, and Y Combinator's internal software team. As of early 2026, Greptile has reviewed over 500 million lines of code in a single month and claims to have prevented more than 180,000 bugs across its customer base. The platform is built on the Anthropic Claude Agent SDK and integrates with GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Jira, Notion, Google Drive, Sentry, and VS Code.

## How Does Greptile Work?

Greptile works by building a full code graph of your entire repository on initial setup, then using a multi-hop investigation engine to evaluate every pull request within the context of that complete picture — not just the diff. When a PR is submitted, Greptile does not just scan the changed files — it traces call chains, data flows, and import graphs across the full repository to identify how the change interacts with code that was not modified. This architecture allows it to catch issues like: a function signature change that silently breaks callers in other modules, an API schema update that conflicts with consumers five files away, or a configuration change that violates a constraint defined in shared infrastructure code. The tradeoff is speed: reviews take several minutes rather than 30 seconds, because Greptile is doing substantially more investigation than reading a diff. The code graph is built once on setup and updated incrementally with each new commit, keeping the analysis fresh without requiring a full re-index for every PR.

### Code Graph Construction

Greptile's code graph construction phase parses your repository into a structured representation of functions, classes, modules, and their relationships. This graph is built once on setup and updated incrementally as new commits arrive. The graph makes "how does X affect Y?" questions answerable in seconds — which is the same engine that powers Greptile's natural language query feature, where developers can ask questions like "How does authentication work in this codebase?" and get accurate, codebase-specific answers.

### Multi-Hop Investigation Engine

The multi-hop investigation engine is what separates Greptile from shallow diff reviewers. For a given PR, Greptile starts at the changed lines and "hops" through the code graph to trace downstream effects. Each hop is an LLM reasoning step that asks: "given this change, what else could break?" The engine follows import chains, function call trees, and data flow paths to a configurable depth. This is why Greptile reviews take several minutes rather than 30 seconds — it is doing substantially more work than reading a diff.

### Confidence Scores

Greptile assigns a confidence score to every review comment it generates. High-confidence comments flag issues where the model is certain something is wrong based on concrete evidence in the code graph. Low-confidence comments surface potential concerns worth a second look but where context may justify the pattern. After the v4 release in early 2026, 43% of all Greptile comments are addressed by developers — up from 30% in v3 — a metric that tracks whether review comments translate into actual code changes. This developer trust metric is the clearest signal that Greptile's precision is improving.

## Greptile v3 and v4: What Changed?

Greptile v3 launched in September 2025 alongside the Series A announcement. It was rebuilt from the ground up on the Anthropic Claude Agent SDK, replacing the prior architecture with a true agentic investigation loop. The core improvement was a 3x increase in critical bug detection compared to v2, driven by the multi-hop reasoning engine's ability to trace cross-file dependencies rather than reasoning locally within diff context. V3 also introduced organization-specific learning — Greptile reads your team's past PR comments and uses them to calibrate future reviews, building implicit understanding of what your team considers acceptable versus flaggable. V3 added MCP server support for IDE and agent integration, and expanded integrations to Jira and Notion for ticket-linked review workflows.

Greptile v4 arrived in early 2026. The headline improvement was accuracy: false positives dropped and the developer comment address rate jumped from 30% to 43%. V4 also refined the confidence scoring system, making it more granular so developers could quickly distinguish "this is almost certainly broken" from "this pattern might be a concern given your team's conventions." The practical impact is that v4 is faster to triage — high-confidence comments surface first and are more often correct.

## Benchmark Results: Where Does Greptile Stand?

Greptile's official benchmark tested 50 real-world bugs from five open-source repositories: Sentry, Cal.com, Grafana, Keycloak, and Discourse. Each repository contributed 10 actual bug-fix pull requests. All tools were tested with default settings, and a tool counted as "catching" a bug only if it generated a line-level comment on the specific code containing the issue — not just a vague general warning about the PR.

| Tool | Overall Catch Rate | High-Severity | Critical |
|---|---|---|---|
| Greptile | 82% | 100% | 58% |
| Cursor Bugbot | 58% | 64% | 58% |
| GitHub Copilot | 54% | 57% | 50% |
| CodeRabbit | 44% | 36% | 33% |
| Graphite | 6% | 0% | 17% |

The 100% high-severity catch rate is Greptile's most striking result. High-severity bugs — the ones that cause data corruption, security vulnerabilities, or production outages — are exactly the category where missing a review comment is most expensive. CodeRabbit, the closest competitor in overall adoption, catches only 36% of high-severity bugs at default settings.

The independent MorphLLM benchmark (March 2026) shows a more nuanced picture of the precision-recall tradeoff, analyzed across a dataset of 317,301 CodeRabbit reviews and 52,699 Greptile reviews:

| Tool | F1 Score | Precision | Recall |
|---|---|---|---|
| CodeRabbit | 51.5% | 50.5% | 52.5% |
| Greptile | 50.2% | 66.2% | 40.4% |

Greptile's 66.2% precision means two out of three comments flag a real issue. CodeRabbit's 52.5% recall means it catches more issues overall, but generates significantly more noise. Which matters more depends on your team: if review fatigue from false positives is your problem, Greptile's precision model is a better fit. If you want to catch everything and are willing to triage noise, CodeRabbit's recall advantage is meaningful.

## Greptile vs CodeRabbit: Depth vs Breadth

Greptile versus CodeRabbit is the central comparison for any team evaluating AI code review in 2026. The tools share a similar surface area — both integrate with GitHub and GitLab, both run automatically on PR open, both generate line-level comments — but the underlying architectures produce meaningfully different review profiles.

CodeRabbit reads the PR diff plus incremental context from recent file history. It uses a declarative `.coderabbit.yaml` configuration file for path-scoped rules, supports SOC 2 Type II compliance, and processes reviews in roughly 30 seconds. It processed 317,301 reviews in the MorphLLM benchmark dataset versus Greptile's 52,699 — about 6x the volume — which itself reflects the difference in review speed. CodeRabbit catches more total issues (52.5% recall vs Greptile's 40.4%) and costs less for high-volume teams ($24/seat/month annual, unlimited reviews). Greptile generates fewer total comments but a higher percentage of them point at real problems (66.2% precision vs CodeRabbit's 50.5%), reviews take several minutes due to multi-hop analysis, and pricing is $30/seat/month with $1 per review over 50 per developer per month. For teams shipping 80-100 PRs per developer per month, Greptile can cost 3-4x more than CodeRabbit. A 50-developer team at 100 PRs each monthly pays roughly $4,000/month on Greptile versus $1,200/month on CodeRabbit — a $34,400/year premium. Whether that premium is justified depends on how much high-severity bug detection is worth to your specific codebase and risk profile.

### Configuration and Learning Models

Greptile and CodeRabbit take opposite approaches to configuration. CodeRabbit uses explicit `.coderabbit.yaml` configuration with path-scoped rules — you write down exactly what you want reviewed, and the tool follows those rules deterministically. Greptile uses implicit learning from your team's past PR comments. If your engineers consistently flag a certain pattern in code review and Greptile sees that feedback, it incorporates it into future reviews for your organization. This learning is isolated per organization — Greptile does not train across customers. The CodeRabbit approach is predictable and auditable; the Greptile approach requires less upfront configuration but produces outputs that are harder to explain.

### Platform Support

Greptile supports GitHub and GitLab only. CodeRabbit supports GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps. For any team on Bitbucket or Azure DevOps, Greptile is not an option — CodeRabbit and Qodo are the primary alternatives. This is a significant gap for enterprise teams with heterogeneous platform environments.

## Greptile vs GitHub Copilot Code Review

GitHub Copilot code review is Greptile's most common enterprise comparison, since Copilot is already installed in most organizations. The core architectural difference is depth: Copilot analyzes the diff with shallow context and returns results in under 30 seconds. Greptile indexes the full repository and runs multi-hop investigation that takes several minutes. In Greptile's benchmark, Copilot caught 54% of bugs overall and 57% of high-severity bugs — significantly below Greptile's 82% and 100%. The tradeoff is speed and integration: Copilot is native to GitHub, requires no additional setup for existing Copilot subscribers, and produces fast enough results to feel synchronous in a PR workflow. Greptile requires a separate subscription, an initial indexing run, and review wait times that some teams find disruptive. For teams where speed-to-review matters more than maximum bug detection — high-velocity startups, teams with existing strong testing coverage — Copilot's embedded review may be sufficient. For teams where a missed high-severity bug carries significant consequences — security-critical infrastructure, financial systems, regulated industries — Greptile's detection advantage is worth the friction.

## Greptile vs Qodo and Cursor Bugbot

Qodo (formerly CodiumAI) and Cursor Bugbot represent two other distinct positions in the AI code review landscape that are worth comparing against Greptile.

Qodo is a full quality platform that includes code review, test generation, and code completion. Where Greptile is review-only and deeply specialized, Qodo provides a broader developer quality workflow. Qodo's review is less architecturally sophisticated than Greptile's multi-hop approach, but teams that want a unified tool for review and test generation may find the consolidated workflow valuable. Qodo supports GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps — broader platform coverage than Greptile.

Cursor Bugbot is the emerging wild card. In Greptile's benchmark, Bugbot achieved a 58% overall catch rate — above Copilot, above CodeRabbit, second only to Greptile. Bugbot is deeply embedded in the Cursor editor ecosystem and is most useful for teams already using Cursor as their primary IDE. Its multi-hop capability is less mature than Greptile's full codebase index approach, but the trajectory is notable. For Cursor-native teams, Bugbot is the review tool to watch in the second half of 2026.

## Greptile Pricing: What Does It Actually Cost?

Greptile pricing is $30/developer/month. Each seat includes 50 reviews per month. Additional reviews beyond the 50-per-seat allocation cost $1 each. There is no free tier — only a 14-day trial. This pricing model works well for teams with lower PR volumes (under 50 PRs per developer per month) but becomes expensive quickly for high-velocity teams.

**Break-even analysis for a 10-developer team:**

| PRs/dev/month | Greptile monthly | CodeRabbit monthly (annual) | Greptile premium |
|---|---|---|---|
| 25 | $300 | $240 | $60 |
| 50 | $300 | $240 | $60 |
| 75 | $550 | $240 | $310 |
| 100 | $800 | $240 | $560 |

At 50 PRs/dev/month or below, the price difference is manageable. Above 75 PRs/dev/month, the cost gap becomes significant. High-velocity teams shipping multiple PRs daily per developer should factor in this pricing model carefully before committing.

Greptile also offers self-hosted deployment on AWS, GCP, Azure, and air-gapped environments. Pricing for self-hosted is negotiated separately and typically reflects enterprise-scale volumes with custom SLAs. This is relevant for compliance-heavy organizations in finance, healthcare, or government where data residency requirements prevent SaaS deployment.

## Key Features

**Natural language codebase queries**: Greptile's code graph powers a question-answering interface where developers can ask "How does billing work?" or "Where is the rate limiting configured?" and get accurate, repository-specific answers. This is useful for onboarding new engineers and for navigating unfamiliar parts of a large codebase.

**Confidence scores**: Every Greptile comment has a confidence rating. Developers can sort and filter by confidence to prioritize the review queue. High-confidence comments from Greptile have a 43% address rate, meaning nearly half translate directly into code changes.

**Integrations**: GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Jira, Notion, Google Drive, Sentry, VS Code. The Jira and Notion integrations allow review findings to be escalated directly into issue trackers without leaving the review context.

**MCP server**: Greptile exposes an MCP server that connects to AI coding agents and IDEs. Developers using Claude Code, Cursor, or other agent-enabled environments can query Greptile's code graph directly during development — asking codebase questions before writing code, not just after submitting a PR.

**REST API**: Full REST API access allows teams to integrate Greptile findings into custom dashboards, security tooling, and deployment pipelines. This is a differentiator from tools that lock review data inside their web UI.

**Auto-detection of config files**: Greptile reads your existing CLAUDE.md, `.cursorrules`, and other AI configuration files to align its review style with your team's documented conventions and preferences.

**Organization-specific learning**: Greptile reads your team's historical PR comments and uses them to calibrate future reviews. No cross-organization training — each company's learning data is isolated.

## Strengths

Greptile's primary strength is bug detection accuracy, particularly for high-severity issues. The 100% high-severity catch rate in Greptile's benchmark is the metric that matters most for risk-critical engineering teams. No other tool in the comparison achieves this. The precision score (66.2%) means developers reviewing Greptile's output are rarely wasting time on false alarms — a major factor in whether review feedback actually gets acted on. The 43% developer address rate post-v4 is unusually high for AI-generated review feedback, suggesting Greptile has calibrated its output toward actionable comments rather than exhaustive but noisy flagging.

The full codebase context is a genuine architectural differentiator. Cross-file dependency analysis, code graph-based reasoning, and multi-hop investigation produce findings that are structurally impossible for diff-only tools to generate. If your codebase is large, complex, and highly interconnected — a monorepo, a microservice mesh, or a platform with extensive shared libraries — Greptile's approach yields qualitatively different review output from tools that read only the changed files.

## Weaknesses

Greptile's most significant weakness is the false positive rate — 11 false positives in benchmark testing versus CodeRabbit's 2. Although Greptile's precision score (66.2%) is higher than CodeRabbit's (50.5%), the absolute number of false positives is still higher because Greptile generates more total comments. For teams already struggling with review noise, this needs to be weighed against the higher true positive rate.

Review latency is a practical concern. Reviews taking several minutes versus 30 seconds changes the workflow dynamics. Developers who submit a PR and want to move on to the next task will find Greptile's review arriving later, potentially after they have already context-switched. Teams with synchronous review cultures may find the latency more disruptive than teams where async review is the norm.

Platform limitations are a hard constraint. GitHub and GitLab only — Bitbucket and Azure DevOps are not supported. No free tier (only a 14-day trial) raises the evaluation cost. And the $30/seat base with per-review overage pricing can become expensive quickly for high-velocity development teams.

## Who Should Use Greptile?

**Complex, interconnected codebases**: Greptile's full repository indexing pays off most when changes in one part of the codebase frequently affect behavior in other parts. Large monorepos, shared library ecosystems, and platform codebases with extensive internal APIs are where multi-hop investigation catches issues that diff-only tools miss.

**Security-critical and regulated industries**: The 100% high-severity detection rate is the key metric for teams where a missed security vulnerability or data corruption bug carries significant consequences — financial systems, healthcare platforms, infrastructure software, and compliance-regulated environments.

**Onboarding and knowledge management**: The natural language codebase query feature turns Greptile into an always-available codebase expert. New engineers can ask "How does X work?" and get accurate answers without hunting through documentation or interrupting senior engineers.

**Teams with low-to-moderate PR volume**: The per-seat base of 50 reviews/month keeps costs predictable for teams shipping fewer than 50 PRs per developer per month. Beyond that threshold, overage costs accumulate quickly.

**Enterprise teams with data residency requirements**: Self-hosted deployment on AWS, GCP, Azure, or air-gapped infrastructure is available, making Greptile viable for organizations that cannot send code to external SaaS services.

## Who Should Look Elsewhere?

**Small teams and solo developers**: No free tier and $30/seat minimum makes Greptile expensive for individual contributors or small teams evaluating AI code review for the first time. CodeRabbit's free tier (for public repositories) or Copilot's bundled review are better entry points.

**Bitbucket and Azure DevOps users**: The platform gap is a hard stop. Greptile does not support these platforms. CodeRabbit (SOC 2 Type II, all four major platforms) or Qodo are the relevant alternatives.

**High-volume teams (80+ PRs/dev/month)**: The overage pricing makes Greptile significantly more expensive than flat-rate competitors at high PR volumes. A 50-developer team at 100 PRs per developer per month pays approximately $4,000/month on Greptile versus $1,200/month on CodeRabbit — a $34,400/year difference.

**Teams prioritizing review speed**: If same-minute review turnaround is a workflow requirement, Greptile's multi-minute analysis is not compatible. Copilot or CodeRabbit at 30-second review times are more appropriate.

## The Bigger Picture: Agentic Code Review

Greptile, Cursor Bugbot, and the emerging class of multi-hop code review agents represent a fundamental shift in how AI participates in code quality. The first generation of AI code review — tools like early CodeRabbit and the initial GitHub Copilot review feature — applied LLMs to diffs, essentially automating the "read this code and say what looks wrong" task. The second generation, exemplified by Greptile v3 and v4, applies agents to investigation: instead of reading the code, the agent actively explores the codebase, builds a structured representation, traces dependencies, and reasons about cascading effects.

This is the same transition that separates a chatbot from an AI agent — moving from responding to a fixed input to actively gathering context and reasoning about it. The implications for code quality are significant. Architectural drift, cross-module regressions, and subtle API contract violations are the categories of bugs most likely to reach production undetected by diff-only review. They are also the bugs most expensive to fix — the ones discovered during an incident at 2 AM rather than during a PR review on a Tuesday afternoon.

The AI code assistant market is estimated at $6 billion in 2026 with 22% compound annual growth and 84% developer adoption — a market large enough to support multiple distinct approaches to the same problem. Greptile's bet is that depth wins for the categories of bugs that matter most.

## Conclusion and Recommendation

Greptile is the best AI code review tool for teams where high-severity bug detection is the primary criterion. The 82% overall catch rate and 100% high-severity detection rate in independent benchmarks are meaningful leads over every competitor, and the 66.2% precision score means developer time spent reviewing Greptile's output is well-spent. If you have a complex codebase, a security-critical application, or a team that has been burned by production bugs that should have been caught in review, Greptile's full-codebase architecture addresses the root cause.

If you are optimizing for coverage over precision — catching the maximum number of issues across a simpler, lower-risk codebase — CodeRabbit's higher recall (52.5% vs Greptile's 40.4%) combined with lower flat-rate pricing makes it the better choice for high-volume teams. If you are on Bitbucket or Azure DevOps, Greptile is not available.

The 14-day trial is the right place to start. Index your repository, run Greptile on a week of real PRs, and measure its comment address rate against whatever AI review tool you are currently using. If the rate is meaningfully higher, the precision improvement is translating to your codebase. If not, the difference is smaller than the benchmarks suggest for your specific context.

## FAQ

The following questions cover the most common decision points for engineering teams evaluating Greptile in 2026 — pricing, benchmark methodology, platform support, and how the v3 to v4 architectural evolution changes the cost-benefit calculation. Greptile's core positioning is high-precision, full-codebase AI code review at $30/seat/month, differentiated from competitors by a multi-hop investigation engine that indexes your entire repository rather than reading only the PR diff. The tool is best suited for complex codebases and security-critical applications where a missed high-severity bug carries significant consequences — its 100% high-severity catch rate in independent benchmarks is the headline metric that sets it apart from GitHub Copilot (57%), CodeRabbit (36%), and Graphite (0%). For teams with simpler codebases, high PR volumes, or platform requirements outside GitHub and GitLab, the answers below explain where alternative tools are more appropriate and why Greptile's pricing model may not be the right fit.

### What is Greptile and how is it different from other AI code review tools?

Greptile is an AI code review platform that indexes your entire repository — not just the pull request diff — to detect bugs, security issues, and architectural regressions. Unlike diff-only tools such as GitHub Copilot Review or early CodeRabbit, Greptile builds a full code graph and uses multi-hop investigation to trace how a change propagates through dependencies across files. This architecture allows it to catch cross-module regressions and API contract violations that other tools structurally cannot detect from diff context alone.

### What are Greptile's benchmark results compared to competitors?

In Greptile's own benchmark across 50 real bugs from five open-source repositories, Greptile achieved an 82% overall bug catch rate, 100% high-severity detection, and 58% critical bug detection. Competitors in the same test: Cursor Bugbot (58% overall), GitHub Copilot (54%), CodeRabbit (44%), Graphite (6%). The independent MorphLLM benchmark (March 2026) shows Greptile at 66.2% precision but 40.4% recall, versus CodeRabbit's 50.5% precision and 52.5% recall — a classic precision vs. recall tradeoff.

### How much does Greptile cost, and is there a free tier?

Greptile costs $30 per developer per month, with 50 PR reviews included per seat. Additional reviews beyond 50 per developer cost $1 each. There is no free tier — only a 14-day free trial. For comparison, CodeRabbit costs $24/seat/month on annual plans with unlimited reviews. High-volume teams shipping 80-100 PRs per developer per month will find Greptile significantly more expensive than flat-rate alternatives.

### Does Greptile work with Bitbucket or Azure DevOps?

No. As of 2026, Greptile supports only GitHub and GitLab. Bitbucket and Azure DevOps are not supported. For teams on these platforms, CodeRabbit (which supports all four major Git platforms) or Qodo are the primary alternatives. This is a hard constraint that eliminates Greptile from consideration for enterprise teams with heterogeneous platform environments.

### What is Greptile v4 and what improved from v3?

Greptile v4 was released in early 2026 as an accuracy-focused update to the v3 architecture. The primary improvements were reduced false positive rates and a higher developer comment address rate — rising from 30% in v3 to 43% in v4, meaning 43% of Greptile's review comments result in actual code changes. V3 (September 2025) was the more architecturally significant release, rebuilding Greptile on the Anthropic Claude Agent SDK with multi-hop investigation and introducing organization-specific learning, MCP server support, and Jira/Notion integrations.
